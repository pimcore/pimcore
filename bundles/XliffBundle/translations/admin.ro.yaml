xliff_export_documents: If you want to translate eg. the whole /en tree to a different
  language, first create a copy of the /en tree. Afterwards use the copied tree in
  the export and select the source language 'en' and the target language 'de'. When
  importing the translated XLIFF file, the contents of the exported documents (in
  this case the copied tree documents) will be overwritten by the German translations
  in the XLIFF file.
xliff_export_objects: Only fields inside a Localized Fields container are recognized.
  When importing the translated XLIFF the source language will be untouched, only
  the target language fields will be overwritten. Use Relations checkbox to include
  Objects & Documents from Dependencies e.g. Relation fields, Properties etc.
xliff_export_notice: Here you can select the documents and objects you want to export
  for external translation.
xliff_import_notice: Select a translated XLIFF file which was previously exported
  by pimcore and then translated by a localization service provider (LSP) or by a
  CAT application. Please aware that the import will overwrite the elements which
  were selected by the import (read also export).
