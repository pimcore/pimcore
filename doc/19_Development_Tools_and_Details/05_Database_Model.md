# Database Model

Pimcore tries to keep a clean and optimized database model for managing the data. Nevertheless,
there are quite a lot of tables around and finding the correct data might be a bit challenging at
the beginning. 

Basically, there are two types of tables
* Default tables which are created during install - for all sorts of data like assets, documents
logs, versions, ... 
* Dynamically created tables which are created during object data model configuration - mainly for all object related
data. 


# Default Tables 
These tables are created during Pimcore install and are always the same.

# Object Tables 
These tables are created and modified dynamically during the configuration of the object data model. 
As a result, they look different on an every Pimcore installation depending on the data model. 

### Objects
As soon as a new object class is created in Pimcore, at least three tables are 
added to the database. The tables have a numerical suffix, denoting the number 
(id) of the object class: `object_query_(id)`, `object_relations_(id)`, 
`object_store_(id)` and an additional database view `object_(id)` which is a combination of 
`object_query_(id)` and `objects`. 
 
| Table / View | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `object_(id)` View | Database view joining object_query_(id) and objects table |
| `object_query_(id)` Table | Use this table to retrieve data incl. inherited data. Data types with relations are usually stored in a serialized form here, too. Pimcore Object-Lists work with this table. |
| `object_relations_(id)` Table | Contains data of fields with relations to objects, assets, etc. |
| `object_store_(id)` Table | This is the main data storage table of an object class. It contains all "flat" data without any relations or external dependencies. |
| `objects` Table | Contains an entry for each and every object in the system. The id field is an auto_increment and the source of the primary key for an object. Metadata about an object is stored in this table, too. |

> When restore of query tables is necessary (for what ever reason) calling `DataObject\Concrete::disableDirtyDetection();` and 
> saving all data objects of class will do the trick. When not disabling dirty detection, there might be data missing in query table. 


#### Simple Data Field Types
Following is an overview of how different object data types are stored in the database. This overview might not be complete.
This overview might be a useful starting point when querying object data with object lists. 


##### Text
Table: object_store_(id)
 
| Name | Data Type | Default | Comment |
| ---- | --------- | ------- | ------- |
| Input | varchar(255) | NULL | / |
| Textarea | longtext | NULL | / |
| wysiwyg | longtext | NULL | Text with HTML-tags |
| password | varchar(255) | NULL | Password - as hash |


##### Number
Table: object_store_(id)
 
| Name | Data Type | Default | Comment |
| ---- | --------- | ------- | ------- |
| Number | double/decimal(64,3) | NULL | Datatype depends on selected precision |
| Slider | double | NULL | / |


##### Date 
Table: object_store_(id)

| Name | Data Type | Default | Comment |
| ---- | --------- | ------- | ------- |
| Date | bigint(20) | NULL  | < 1970 = negative Timestamp |
| Date & Time | bigint(20) | NULL | < 1970 = negative Timestamp |
| Time | varchar(5) | NULL | String - e.g.: "12:00" |


##### Select 
Table: object_store_(id)
 
| Name | Data Type | Default | Comment |
| ---- | --------- | ------- | ------- |
| Select | varchar(255) | NULL | Selected value |
| User | varchar(255) | NULL | Pimcore User-ID |
| Country | varchar(255) | NULL | Country code |
| Language | varchar(255) | NULL | Language code |
| Multiselection | text | NULL | String, selected values, separated by "," |
| Countries (Multiselect) | text | NULL | String, selected language-codes, separated by "," |
| Languages (Multiselect) | text | NULL | String, selected language-codes, separated by "," |


##### Relations
Table: object_relations_(id) & object_meta_data_(id)

* Data fields of relation types are stored in extra tables
* Data fields are not stored in distinct columns, but as rows, whereas the field name is in an extra column `fieldname`
* The column `type` specifies the type of the linked resource (Object, Document, Asset)
* The columns `src_id` and `dest_id` define the relation / the link between the objects. 
* Column `index` is used to specify the order of the relations
* Columns `ownertype`, `ownername` and `position` are used when relations are within field collections, localized fields, object bricks, etc.  
* The data type `Advanced Many-To-One Object Relation` stores the extra data in a table `object_meta_data_(id)` - the column `column` 
specifies the name of the meta item and `data` stores the value


##### Structured

| Name | Comment |
| ---- | ------- |
| Table | Table data is stored as a string - serialized. |
| Structured Table | Each table cell is stored distinctively; schema: (fieldname)__(row key)#(column key) |
| Field-Collections | see special data fields later | 
| Objectbricks | see special data fields later | 
| Localized Fields | see special data fields later |


##### Geographic
Table: object_store_(id)
 
| Name | Data Type | Default | Comment |
| ---- | --------- | ------- | ------- |
| Geographic Point | double | NULL | Creates two columns: ‘(name)__longitude’ and ‘(name)__latitude’ |
| Geographic Bounds | double | NULL | Creates four columns: ‘(name)__NElongitude’, ‘(name)__NElatitude’, ‘(name)__SWlongitude’ und ‘(name)__SWlatitude’ | 
| Geographic Polygon | longtext | NULL | Serialized geo-data |


##### Other

| Name | Data Type | Default | Comment |
| ---- | --------- | ------- | ------- |
| Image | int(11) | NULL | ID of the image asset |
| Image Advanced | int(11), text | NULL | Creates a column `(name)__image`(int)  for the image assets id and the column `(name)__hotspots`(text). Hotspots are stored serialized. |
| Video | text | NULL | Serialized data |
| Checkbox | tinyint(1) | NULL | Boolean value (1 = true) |
| Link | text | NULL | Serialized data |


#### Special Data Fields

##### Objectbricks

| Table/View | Purpose |
| ---------- | ------- |
| object_brick_query_(id) Table | Analog to object_query_(id) |
| object_brick_store_(id) Table | Main data storage |


##### Localized fields
 
| Table/View | Purpose |
| ---------- | ------- |
| object_localized_(id)_(language-code) View | A database view per language, combining regular and localized data fields |
| object_localized_data_(id) Table | Stores localized field data |
| object_localized_query_(id)_(language-code) Table | Analog to object_query_(id) |


##### Field Collections
 
| Table/View | Purpose |
| ---------- | ------- |
| object_collection_(collection-name)_(object-id) | Stores data of the field collections fields and the order (index) |
