# Tools and Features

This section of documentation gives an overview over tools and features provided in or for the Pimcore backend UI but also can
be used via Pimcore PHP API. 

The topics include insights to [Versioning](./01_Versioning.md), [Notes and Events](./05_Notes_and_Events.md), 
[Tags](./09_Tags.md), [Perspectives](./13_Perspectives.md) and much much more.
