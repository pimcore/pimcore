# Updating Pimcore

Please check the [Upgrade Notes](../README.md) in detail before any update. 

## Updating from Version <= 4 to Version 5
Pimcore 5 is build on an entire different platform/framework (Symfony replaced ZF1), therefore we cannot 
offer an automatic update and migration scenario. But we've created a [migration guide](./01_Upgrade_from_4_to_5/README.md) 
that helps you to migrate your application step by step. 

## Upgrading within a Major Version
- Use the built-in update functionality:  *Tools* > *Update*
