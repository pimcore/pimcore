# Upgrade Notes

## 6.3.0
- Asset Metadata: character `~` is not allowed anymore for (predefined/custom) metadata naming. All existing and new metadata name with '~' converts to '---'. This change is introduced to support Localized columns in asset grid [#5093](https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/pull/5093)

- Grid helper functions are moved from `bundles/AdminBundle/Resources/public/js/pimcore/object/helpers/gridcolumnconfig.js(removed)` to `bundles/AdminBundle/Resources/public/js/pimcore/element/helpers/gridColumnConfig.js`

#### Removed jQuery from Admin UI & E-Commerce Back Office
[BC Break] Replaced jQuery functions & libraries with vanilla JS or ExtJS equivalents. [Read more](https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/pull/5222#issuecomment-552452543)  
To get jQuery back in the admin UI, please use the [this code snippet](https://gist.github.com/brusch/73b3afda260550718298630579dc2d06).

The following files have been removed:
  ```
  bundles/AdminBundle/Resources/public/js/lib/jquery-3.4.1.min.js
  bundles/EcommerceFrameworkBundle/Resources/public/vendor/jquery-1.11.1.min.js
  bundles/EcommerceFrameworkBundle/Resources/public/vendor/jquery-2.1.3.min.js

  ```

## 6.2.2
- Object Keys: characters `>` and `<` not allowed anymore.

## 6.2.0 
- Support for links and folders as a fallback document, details see [#4860](https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/pull/4860)
- Documents & DataObjects: save button (visible when user has no publish permission) does not unpublish element anymore (if user has unpublish permission). 
  Details see [#4905](https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/issues/4905)


### Workflow Refactorings
- Notifications for workflows now support Pimcore notifications. Due to that, some namespaces
  were renamed. If you don't have overwritten any of the internal classes, no action is needed. 
   - `Pimcore\Workflow\EventSubscriber\NotificationEmailSubscriber` became `Pimcore\Workflow\EventSubscriber\NotificationSubscriber`  
   - `Pimcore\Workflow\NotificationEmail\NotificationEmailInterface` became `Pimcore\Workflow\NotificationEmail\NotificationInterface` 


## 6.1.2
- Sessions: the native PHP session mechanism is now the default (instead of `session.handler.native_file`). 
To use the former handler use the following config: 
```yaml
framework:
    session:
        handler_id:  session.handler.native_file
        save_path:   "%kernel.root_dir%/../var/sessions"
```
If you have configured your own session handler nothing will change. 

- Bugfix for 6.1.0 - only relevant, when you directly implement interfaces. If you just extend existing E-Commerce Framework
   implementations, default implementations for the new methods are provided.
   - New method in `CartFactoryInterface`: `public function getCartReadOnlyMode(): string;` - default implementation in `CartFactory` available.
   
## 6.1.0 

### E-Commerce Framework Refactorings
- New methods in interfaces - only relevant, when you directly implement interfaces. If you just extend existing E-Commerce Framework
  implementations, default implementations for the new methods are provided.
  - New method in `EcommerceFrameworkBundle\EnvironmentInterface`: `public function setDefaultCurrency(Currency $currency);` - default implementation in `Environment` available.
  - New method in `CartInterface`: `public function getPricingManagerTokenInformationDetails(): array` - default implementation in `AbstractCart` available.
  - New method in `CartInterface`: `public function isCalculated(): bool` - default implementation in `AbstractCart` available.
  - New method in `CartPriceCalculatorInterface`: `public function getAppliedPricingRules(): array;` - default implementation in `CartPriceCalculator` available.
  - New method in `BracketInterface`: `public function getConditionsByType(string $typeClass): array;` - default implementation in `Bracket` available.
  - New method in `RuleInterface`: `public function getConditionsByType(string $typeClass): array` - default implementation in `Rule` available.
  - New method in `VoucherServiceInterface`: `public function getPricingManagerTokenInformationDetails(CartInterface $cart, string $locale = null): array;` - default implementation in `DefaultService` available.
  - New method in `CartFactoryInterface`: `public function getCartReadOnlyMode(): string;` - default implementation in `CartFactory` available.
  
- Changed return type of `applyCartRules(CartInterface $cart)` in `PricingManagerInterface` - from `PricingManagerInterface` to `array`  
- Introduction of new Checkout Manager architecture. It is parallel to the old architecture, which is deprecated now and will be removed in 
  Pimcore 7. For details see [Checkout Manager Details](../../10_E-Commerce_Framework/13_Checkout_Manager/08_Checkout_Manager_Details.md).

### E-Commerce Back Office
