# Commandline Interface

Pimcore offers certain tasks a commandline command. 
Use the following command to get a full list of available tasks: 

```php
./bin/console list
``` 

The commandline interface is based on Symfony/Pimcore console. See its [documentation](../19_Development_Tools_and_Details/11_Console_CLI.md) 
for more information and how to add custom commands to it.
