# Upgrading Pimcore from Version 10.x to Version 11

## Tasks to Do Prior the Update

### Migrate System Settings

System settings are using LocationAwareConfigRepository in Pimcore 11. To keep your specific settings, please follow the steps below: 

### Database
Make sure to change the type from `json_array` to `json` when upgrading to 11, since the type `json_array` is removed in doctrine/dbal 3.
Use the following script to list the columns which contains the `json_array`.
```bash
mysqldump -u <USERNAME> -p <PASSWORD> --no-data <DATABASENAME> | grep -i json_array
```

#### Appearance & Branding 
Appearance & Branding settings will be separated from the system settings in Pimcore 11 and stored in `var/config/admin_system_settings/admin_system_settings.yaml` by default. Please copy every relevant settings from `var/config/system.yaml` into `var/config/admin_system_settings/admin_system_settings.yaml` to keep your settings. 

To save these settings into the settings store, you can use the following configuration:
```yaml
pimcore_admin:
    config_location:
        admin_system_settings:
            write_target:
                type: 'settings-store'
            read_target:
                type: 'settings-store'
```

#### System Settings

Please copy all relevant settings from `var/config/system.yaml` into `var/config/system_settings/system_settings.yaml`.

To save system settings into the settings store, please add the following to your configuration:
```yaml
pimcore:
    config_location:
        system_settings:
            write_target:
                type: 'settings-store'
            read_target:
                type: 'settings-store'
```

### Configuration Storage Settings
As some features were moved to separate bundles, their configuration storage settings might need to be moved. This is a two steps process:
1) Remove settings before the update.
2) Re-Add settings after the extracted bundles installation.

The relevant configs are: 
```yaml
# pimcore_custom_reports:
#  config_location:
#    custom_reports:
#      write_target:
#        type: 'settings-store'

# pimcore_web_to_print:
#  config_location:
#    web_to_print:
#      write_target:
#        type: 'settings-store'

# pimcore_static_routes:
#  config_location:
#    staticroutes:
#      write_target:
#        type: 'settings-store'
```

### Web2Print
If you are using the Web2Print functionality, set the flag "Enable Web2Print documents in default documents view" to true to ensure the PimcoreWebToPrintBundle gets installed by default.

If you are not using Web2Print functionality, set the flag to false.

### WYSIWYG-Editor
Please add all html tags with attributes you want to allow to the html_sanitizer like described [here](../../03_Documents/01_Editables/40_WYSIWYG.md)

### Redis Cache Configuration
If you are using `Redis` adapter for `Pimcore\Cache` then adapt the configuration as below:
```yaml
framework:
    cache:
        pools:
            pimcore.cache.pool:
                #tags: true // this line needs to be removed
                public: true 
                default_lifetime: 31536000  # 1 year
                adapter: cache.adapter.redis_tag_aware # use this instead of pimcore.cache.adapter.redis_tag_aware
                ...
```

## Update Pimcore via Composer

Update Pimcore to Pimcore 11 via composer statement `composer require -W pimcore/pimcore:^11.0 pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle`. 

Depending on your setup, it might be necessary to include additional dependencies in the update statement and/or to clean up the `composer.lock` file and the `vendor` folder.

After composer, some tasks like `bin/console assets:install` might fail due to necessary additional adaptions before the Symfony container can be built again. For more info, see the following [Tasks](#tasks-to-do-after-the-update) section.

## Tasks to Do After the Update

### Admin Bundle
Register the admin-ui-classic-bundle in Kernel (and adapt method signature if necessary): 
`src/Kernel.php`
```php
public function registerBundlesToCollection(BundleCollection $collection): void
{
    // pimcore bundles
    $collection->addBundle(new \Pimcore\Bundle\AdminBundle\PimcoreAdminBundle(), 60);
}
```

### Some Code Changes

- Update `config/packages/security.yaml` to the latest format. As reference use [security.yaml](https://github.com/pimcore/skeleton/blob/11.x/config/packages/security.yaml) of our skeleton. 
- Update references from `@PimcoreCoreBundle/Resources/config/...` to `@PimcoreCoreBundle/config/...`
  - especially in `config/routes.yaml` (you probably also need to change `routing.yml` to `routing.yaml` there). 

### Install Extracted Bundles via Composer if Necessary

Add the extracted bundles (such as PimcoreEcommerceFrameworkBundle or PimcorePersonalizationBundle) via composer if necessary. 

```bash 
composer require pimcore/system-info-bundle pimcore/file-explorer-bundle pimcore/personalization-bundle pimcore/google-marketing-bundle pimcore/web-to-print-bundle pimcore/ecommerce-framework-bundle pimcore/newsletter-bundle
```

Skip bundles as per your requirements. 


### Activate Extracted Bundles in `config/bundles.php` if Necessary

Update `config/bundles.php` and add all the needed extracted bundles to the array: 

```php
  \Pimcore\Bundle\EcommerceFrameworkBundle\PimcoreEcommerceFrameworkBundle::class => ['all' => true], 
  \Pimcore\Bundle\PersonalizationBundle\PimcorePersonalizationBundle::class => ['all' => true],
  \Pimcore\Bundle\GlossaryBundle\PimcoreGlossaryBundle::class => ['all' => true],
  \Pimcore\Bundle\SeoBundle\PimcoreSeoBundle::class => ['all' => true],
  \Pimcore\Bundle\SimpleBackendSearchBundle\PimcoreSimpleBackendSearchBundle::class => ['all' => true],
  \Pimcore\Bundle\CustomReportsBundle\PimcoreCustomReportsBundle::class => ['all' => true],
  \Pimcore\Bundle\GoogleMarketingBundle\PimcoreGoogleMarketingBundle::class => ['all' => true],
  \Pimcore\Bundle\ApplicationLoggerBundle\PimcoreApplicationLoggerBundle::class => ['all' => true],
  \Pimcore\Bundle\WebToPrintBundle\PimcoreWebToPrintBundle::class => ['all' => true], 
  \Pimcore\Bundle\TinymceBundle\PimcoreTinymceBundle::class => ['all' => true],
  \Pimcore\Bundle\StaticRoutesBundle\PimcoreStaticRoutesBundle::class => ['all' => true],
  \Pimcore\Bundle\NewsletterBundle\PimcoreNewsletterBundle::class => ['all' => true],
  \Pimcore\Bundle\WordExportBundle\PimcoreWordExportBundle::class => ['all' => true],
  \Pimcore\Bundle\XliffBundle\PimcoreXliffBundle::class => ['all' => true],
  \Pimcore\Bundle\FileExplorerBundle\PimcoreFileExplorerBundle::class => ['all' => true],
  \Pimcore\Bundle\SystemInfoBundle\PimcoreSystemInfoBundle::class => ['all' => true],
```

Remove bundles as per your requirements. 


### Configuration Storage Settings - Part 2
Reactivate the configuration storage settings for the extracted bundles as needed: 
```yaml
#custom_reports
pimcore_custom_reports:
  config_location:
    custom_reports:
      ...

#web_to_print
pimcore_web_to_print:
  config_location:
    web_to_print:
       ...

#static_routes
pimcore_static_routes:
  config_location:
    staticroutes:
       ...
```

### Migrations

As soon as the Symfony container can be built again, you can execute all the migrations:
```bash
bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```


### Web2Print
If you do not use the Web2Print functionality, then please make sure to run the following command and queries to clean up your system:
```bash
bin/console pimcore:documents:cleanup printpage printcontainer
```

```sql
DELETE FROM `users_permission_definitions` WHERE `key` = 'web2print_settings';
UPDATE `users` SET `permissions`=REGEXP_REPLACE(`permissions`, '(?:^|,)web2print_settings(?:$|,)', '') WHERE `permissions` REGEXP '(?:^|,)web2print_settings(?:$|,)';
```

### Newsletters
If you do not use the Newsletter functionality, then please make sure to run the following command to clean up your system:
```bash
bin/console pimcore:documents:cleanup newsletter
```

### Remove orphaned custom settings
Since the facedetect support was removed in v11, we recommend to remove the corresponding custom settings 
in the database. You can do that by running the following commands: 
```bash
bin/console pimcore:assets:remove-custom-setting faceCoordinates
bin/console pimcore:assets:remove-custom-setting disableFocalPointDetection
bin/console pimcore:assets:remove-custom-setting disableImageFeatureAutoDetection
```

### Rebuild classes, objectBricks, fieldCollections and customLayouts
Make sure you ran the following commands to rebuild the classes, objectBricks, fieldCollections and customLayouts:
```bash
bin/console doctrine:migration:exec 'Pimcore\Bundle\CoreBundle\Migrations\Version20240708083500'
```

### Additional Cleanups 

- Remove `var/config/system.yaml` after migrating all settings. 

### Server Configuration
- WebDav: please keep in mind that the nginx configuration has changed due to the WebDav path being moved. Please adapt your configuration accordingly by following the instruction under the WebDav section in the upgrade notes page.

### Update Symfony Messenger Worker Configuration
With Pimcore 11, certain Symfony Messenger tasks were moved to a separate receiver. Make sure you adapt your Symfony Messenger worker configuration (e.g. your supervisor configuration [here](https://github.com/pimcore/skeleton/blob/11.x/.docker/supervisord.conf#LL5C39-L5C90) so that all receivers are consumed. Newly added consumers are: 
- `pimcore_scheduled_tasks`
- `pimcore_image_optimize`
- `pimcore_asset_update`
- `pimcore_search_backend_message`
