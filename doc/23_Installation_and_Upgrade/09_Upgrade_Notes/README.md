    ```
-  Removed legacy callback from LocationAwareConfigRepository. Therefore, configurations in the old php file format are not supported anymore.

            - en
            - de
```

#### [Ecommerce General] :

- Ecommerce bundle has been moved into a package `pimcore/ecommerce-bundle`. If you wish to continue using the ecommerce framework, then please require the package in your composer.json and install it after enabling in `config/bundles.php`.
- The constructor of the following services has been changed, please adapt your custom implementation accordingly:
    - `IndexService\ProductList\DefaultMysql`, `IndexService\ProductList\DefaultFindologic`
    - `IndexService\Worker\AbstractElasticSearch`, `IndexService\Worker\DefaultFindologic`, `IndexService\Worker\DefaultMysql`, `IndexService\Worker\OptimizedMysql`
    - `IndexService\Config\AbstractConfig` and it's sub-classes.
    - `Tracking\Tracker\Analytics\AbstractAnalyticsTracker` and it's sub-classes.
- Ecommerce related Events have been moved. Please check and adapt the Events' namespaces.
- [ClassDefinition\LinkGeneratorInterface] method signature has changed, instead of `Pimcore\Model\DataObject\Concrete` a `object` is used.
-  Elasticsearch 7 support was removed
-  Config option `es_client_params` in `index_service` was removed
-  Remove deprecated methods `check()` and `exists()` from class `Pimcore\Bundle\EcommerceFrameworkBundle\VoucherService\Reservation`

#### [IndexService] :

-  Please make sure to rebuild your product index to make sure changes apply accordingly (this is relevant for mysql and elasticsearch indices). As an alternative you could manually rename and remove `o_` from all index columns/fields.


#### [Product Interfaces] :

-  Changed return type-hints of `CheckoutableInterface` methods `getOSPrice`, `getOSPriceInfo`, `getOSAvailabilityInfo`, `getPriceSystemName`, `getAvailabilitySystemName`, `getPriceSystemImplementation`, `getAvailabilitySystemImplementation` to be non-nullable.

-----------------
### Elements

#### [All] :

-  Added `setParentId`, `setType` and `setParent` methods to `Pimcore\Model\Element\ElementInterface`
-  Removed fallback to parent id 1, when an element with a non-existing parent id gets created.
-  Passing $force parameter as boolean is not valid anymore in `getById`, `getByPath`, `getElementById` methods. Instead, please pass it as an associative array ( eg.`['force' => true]`).
-  Changed method signature on `Pimcore\Model\Element\ElementInterface::save()`, this changes the `::save()` method on all classes (e.g. DataObjects and Pages) implementing the interface, including those inheriting from `Concrete`/`AbstractObject`, see [#13207](https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/issues/13207)
- Removed deprecated `getTotalCount()` method
-  Removed the deprecated `Pimcore\Model\Element\Service::getType()`, use `Pimcore\Model\Element\Service::getElementType()` instead.
- `Element\Service::getValidKey()` strips all control/unassigned, invalid and some more special (e.g. tabs, line-breaks, form-feed & vertical whitespace) characters.
- Removed deprecated `Pimcore\Model\Element\Service::getSaveCopyName()` method, please use the `Pimcore\Model\Element\Service::getSafeCopyName()` method instead.


#### [DataObjects][Assets][Documents] :

-  Datetime values for scheduled tasks, application logger and notifications are now displayed in the local timezone.


#### [DataObjects][Documents] :

- Calling `getChildren/getSiblings` on `AbstractObject`, `Document` and `Asset` now returns unloaded listing. If the list is not traveresed immediately, then it is required to call `load()` explicitily.
- Removed deprecated methods `getObject()` and `setObject()` on the classes `Pimcore\Model\Document\Link` and `Pimcore\Model\DataObject\Data\Link`, please use `getElement()` and `setElement()` instead.


-----------------

### Assets

-  Refactored `Pimcore\Model\Asset::getMetadata` method to allow listing of all metadata entries filtered by a specific language. Prior this version, the language filter was only available when a specific metadata name was defined in the parameters. Added native type hints and related tests.
-  Removed the deprecated `marshal()/unmarshal()` methods for metadata, use `normalize()/denormalize()` methods instead.
-  Removed the deprecated `Import from Server` and `Import from URL` options.

-  Image thumbnails: Removed support for using custom callbacks for thumbnail transformations.
-  Removed loading assets via fixed namespace only. Custom Asset Types can be configured.
-  Thumbnails: improved method signature for `$thumbnail->getPath()`. You may now pass options as array `$thumbnail->getPath(["deferredAllowed" => true, "frontend" => false]);`
- Removed deprecated property `Pimcore\Model\Asset::$types`, use `getTypes()` instead


#### [Image Optimizer] :

-  Removed all the Image Optimizer services (e.g. PngCrushOptimizer, JpegoptimOptimizer etc.) as image optimization is done by the new package spatie/image-optimizer.


#### [WebDAV] :

-  WebDAV url has been changed from `https://YOUR-DOMAIN/admin/asset/webdav` to `https://YOUR-DOMAIN/asset/webdav`

   As result of this change, the following changes are required in your nginx configuration:
    ```
    # Assets
    ....
    location ~* ^(?!/admin)(.+?)....
    ```
    New:
    ```
    # Assets
    ....
    location ~* ^(?!/admin|/asset/webdav)(.+?)....
    ```

-----------------

-  Text data types now set their corresponding database columns to `null` instead of `''` (empty string) when empty.
-  Method `Concrete::getClass()` throws NotFoundException if class is not found for an object.
-  Change type hints of `Pimcore\Model\DataObject\QuantityValue\QuantityValueConverterInterface::convert()`:
    ```php
    public function convert(QuantityValue $quantityValue, Unit $toUnit): QuantityValue;
    ```
    ```php
    public function convert(AbstractQuantityValue $quantityValue, Unit $toUnit): AbstractQuantityValue;
    ```

For details, please see [#10005](https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/issues/10005#issuecomment-907007745)

### Documents

- Removed the functionality to input `metadata` html tags in Settings section of the document.

```yaml
pimcore_seo:
    redirects:
        auto_create_redirects: true
```
