- [Asset] Added adapter (as alternative to LibreOffice) for preview generation of supported document type assets and set it as default adapter.
- [Web2Print] Added settings option, configuration and processor for PDF preview and generation

#### [Maintenance] :

-  Removed `--async` & `--force` option from `pimcore:maintenance` command. Please make sure to setup to `messenger:consume pimcore_maintenance` independent

#### [Migrations] :

-  Removed `executeMigrationsUp` from `Pimcore\Composer`.

   Make sure that migrations are executed by running the command `bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --prefix=Pimcore\\Bundle\\CoreBundle`.

#### [Naming] :

-  Renamed master, blacklist and whitelist to main, blocklist, allowlist


#### [Permissions] :

-  Permission for DataObjects Classes has been structured in a more granular way to have more control. Field collections, objects bricks, classification stores and quantity value units now have their own permission.

- Removed AdminSessionHandler and AdminSessionListener. The session is now handled by Symfony.
- Removed `SessionConfiguratorInterface` & `SessionConfigurator` so services with tag `pimcore.session.configurator` will not register session bags anymore.

- TargetingSessionBagListener - changed the signature of `__construct`.
- `AdminSessionHandler` requires session from request stack.
- `EcommerceFrameworkBundle\SessionEnvironment` not loading from or storing into session in cli mode anymore.
- `EcommerceFrameworkBundle\Tracking\TrackingManager` requires session from request stack.

-----------------
### Ecommerce
#### [Ecommerce General] :

- The constructor of the following services has been changed, please adapt your custom implementation accordingly:
    - `IndexService\ProductList\DefaultMysql`, `IndexService\ProductList\DefaultFindologic`
    - `IndexService\Worker\AbstractElasticSearch`, `IndexService\Worker\DefaultFindologic`, `IndexService\Worker\DefaultMysql`, `IndexService\Worker\OptimizedMysql`
    - `IndexService\Config\AbstractConfig` and it's sub-classes.
    - `Tracking\Tracker\Analytics\AbstractAnalyticsTracker` and it's sub-classes.
- Ecommerce related Events have been moved. Please check and adapt the Events' namespaces.
- [ClassDefinition\LinkGeneratorInterface] method signature has changed, instead of `Pimcore\Model\DataObject\Concrete` a `object` is used.

#### [Product Interfaces] :

-  Changed return type-hints of `CheckoutableInterface` methods `getOSPrice`, `getOSPriceInfo`, `getOSAvailabilityInfo`, `getPriceSystemName`, `getAvailabilitySystemName`, `getPriceSystemImplementation`, `getAvailabilitySystemImplementation` to be non-nullable.

-----------------
### Elements

#### [All] :

-  Added `setParentId`, `setType` and `setParent` methods to `Pimcore\Model\Element\ElementInterface`
-  Removed fallback to parent id 1, when an element with a non-existing parent id gets created.
-  Passing $force parameter as boolean is not valid anymore in `getById`, `getByPath`, `getElementById` methods. Instead, please pass it as an associative array ( eg.`['force' => true]`).
-  Changed method signature on `Pimcore\Model\Element\ElementInterface::save()`, this changes the `::save()` method on all classes (e.g. DataObjects and Pages) implementing the interface, including those inheriting from `Concrete`/`AbstractObject`, see [#13207](https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/issues/13207)
- Removed deprecated `getTotalCount()` method
-  Removed the deprecated `Pimcore\Model\Element\Service::getType()`, use `Pimcore\Model\Element\Service::getElementType()` instead.
- `Element\Service::getValidKey()` strips all control/unassigned, invalid and some more special (e.g. tabs, line-breaks, form-feed & vertical whitespace) characters.
- Removed deprecated `Pimcore\Model\Element\Service::getSaveCopyName()` method, please use the `Pimcore\Model\Element\Service::getSafeCopyName()` method instead.

- Removed deprecated methods `getObject()` and `setObject()` on the classes `Pimcore\Model\Document\Link` and `Pimcore\Model\DataObject\Data\Link`, please use `getElement()` and `setElement()` instead.


-----------------

### Assets

-  Refactored `Pimcore\Model\Asset::getMetadata` method to allow listing of all metadata entries filtered by a specific language. Prior this version, the language filter was only available when a specific metadata name was defined in the parameters. Added native type hints and related tests.

-  Removed loading assets via fixed namespace only. Custom Asset Types can be configured.
-  Thumbnails: improved method signature for `$thumbnail->getPath()`. You may now pass options as array `$thumbnail->getPath(["deferredAllowed" => true, "frontend" => false]);`

#### [Image Optimizer] :

-  Removed all the Image Optimizer services (e.g. PngCrushOptimizer, JpegoptimOptimizer etc.) as image optimization is done by the new package spatie/image-optimizer.


#### [WebDAV] :

-  WebDAV url has been changed from `https://YOUR-DOMAIN/admin/asset/webdav` to `https://YOUR-DOMAIN/asset/webdav`

   As result of this change, the following changes are required in your nginx configuration:
    ```
    # Assets
    ....
    location ~* ^(?!/admin)(.+?)....
    ```
    New:
    ```
    # Assets
    ....
    location ~* ^(?!/admin|/asset/webdav)(.+?)....
    ```

-  Text data types now set their corresponding database columns to `null` instead of `''` (empty string) when empty.
-  Method `Concrete::getClass()` throws NotFoundException if class is not found for an object.
-  Change type hints of `Pimcore\Model\DataObject\QuantityValue\QuantityValueConverterInterface::convert()`:
    ```php
    public function convert(QuantityValue $quantityValue, Unit $toUnit): QuantityValue;
    ```
    ```php
    public function convert(AbstractQuantityValue $quantityValue, Unit $toUnit): AbstractQuantityValue;
    ```

### Documents

- Removed the functionality to input `metadata` html tags in Settings section of the document.
