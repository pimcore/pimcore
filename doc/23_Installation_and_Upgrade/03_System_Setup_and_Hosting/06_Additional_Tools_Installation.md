# Additional Tools Installation

Pimcore uses some 3rd party applications for certain functionalities, such as video transcoding (FFMPEG), image optimization (advpng, cjpeg, ...), and many others. For a full list of additional tools required or recommended for Pimcore, please visit [Pimcore System Requirements](../01_System_Requirements.md). 

The installation of some of the tools is covered in this guide and should work at least on every Debian based Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, ...). 
For other Linux distributions you might have to adopt some commands to your platform-specific environment, but we try to use as many statically linked software as possible, that can be used on any x64 Linux platform.  

> It's important that all tools (incl. `composer`) are added to the `$PATH` env. variable, so that Pimcore is able to find the executables. 
If you're not able to control the `$PATH` variable, you can also [manually configure the paths for each application](https://github.com/pimcore/skeleton/blob/11.x/config/services.yaml).


## Composer 
Please visit the official install guide for Composer: [https://getcomposer.org/](https://getcomposer.org/)

## FFMPEG

Please keep in mind that many Linux/GNU distributions ship FFMPEG only with free codecs, 
so they do not support commonly used video codecs such as mpeg4 and many others.   

```bash
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

## PDF Generation 

It's possible to either choose to install LibreOffice/Chromium or to use them via Gotenberg (Docker-powered API).

### LibreOffice, pdftotext, Inkscape, ...

```bash
apt-get install libreoffice libreoffice-script-provider-python libreoffice-math xfonts-75dpi poppler-utils inkscape libxrender1 libfontconfig1 ghostscript
```

### Gotenberg

To install it, please add it in your Docker Compose services stack as [https://gotenberg.dev/docs/getting-started/installation#docker-compose](https://gotenberg.dev/docs/getting-started/installation#docker-compose).

Configure the Docker services accordingly:

- `pimcore.gotenberg.base_url` which by default to `http://gotenberg:3000`
- `pimcore.documents.preview_url_prefix` for example to `http://nginx:80`

Make sure to add and install the required library via composer:
```bash
composer require gotenberg/gotenberg-php ^2.0
```


### Chromium (Chrome Headless) - deprecated

> Chromium is used to generate previews of document pages. 
> This functionality is now also provided by Gotenberg, therefore Chromium support has been deprecated in favour of Gotenberg. 
 
First of all, you need to add and install the required library via composer:
```bash
composer require chrome-php/chrome
```

You can then directly install and use the Chromium binary locally or use it in Docker Container, accessing it via WebSocket connection.

#### Locally
Please follow the steps on [https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium) for installing Chromium locally.


#### Docker
Add a new service as:
```dockerfile
    chrome:
        image: browserless/chrome
```
and set accordingly:
- config `pimcore.chromium.uri` value (e.g. `ws://chrome:3000/`)
- web2print settings hostUrl as the Docker web server service (e.g. `http://nginx:80`)

## Image Optimizers

### JPEGOptim

```bash
wget https://github.com/imagemin/jpegoptim-bin/raw/main/vendor/linux/jpegoptim -O /usr/local/bin/jpegoptim
chmod 0755 /usr/local/bin/jpegoptim
```

## PngQuant

```bash
apt-get install pngquant
```

## OptiPng

```bash
apt-get install optipng
```

## Exiftool

```bash
apt-get install libimage-exiftool-perl
```

## WebP

Install webp for [WebP-Support](../../04_Assets/03_Working_with_Thumbnails/01_Image_Thumbnails.md)

```bash
apt-get install webp
```

## Graphviz

Install graphviz for [Workflow](../../07_Workflow_Management/README.md)

```bash
apt-get install graphviz
```


# Check your installation (requires pimcore/system-info-bundle package)

You can check system requirements via Admin UI `Tools` / `System Info & Tools` / `System-Requirements Check` menu.

Or via following CLI command:

```bash
bin/console pimcore:system:requirements:check
```
