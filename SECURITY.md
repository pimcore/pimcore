# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think that you have found a security issue, 
don’t use the bug tracker and don’t publish it publicly. 
Instead, all security issues must be reported via a private vulnerability report.
Additionally, we also check issues reported via [huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/repos/pimcore/pimcore/).


## Resolving Process
Every submitted security issue is handled with top priority by following these steps: 

1. Confirm the vulnerability
2. Determine the severity
3. Contact reporter
4. Work on a patch
5. Get a CVE identification number (may be done by the reporter or a security service provider)
6. Patch reviewing 
7. Tagging a new release for supported versions
8. Publish security announcement
