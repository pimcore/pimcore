## Klarna Checkout PHP library
Klarna Checkout is a revolutionary new payment solution that is changing the way
people shop online. First, consumers verify their purchase with a minimal
amount of information through intelligent identification, securing your order
immediately, and then complete their payment afterwards – separating buying
from paying and dramatically increasing conversion. Klarna Checkout also allows
merchants to offer all payment methods through one supplier, minimizing
administration, costs and integration time.

## About Klarna
Klarna was founded in Stockholm in 2005 with the idea of providing a
zero-friction online payment solution that would allow consumers and merchants
to interact with each other as safely and simply as possible. We do this by
letting the consumer receive the goods first and pay afterwards, while we assume
the credit and fraud risks for the merchants. Today, Klarna is one of Europe's
fastest growing companies. In just 8 years, we've grown to 800 employees
operating in 7 European countries with over 8 million consumers. But we are not
satisfied with that. Our goal is to become market leaders within invoice-based
payments worldwide and change the way the world shops online.
