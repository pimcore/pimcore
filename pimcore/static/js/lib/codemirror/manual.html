    <h2 id="usage">Basic Usage</h2>

    <p>Inside the editor, the tab key is used to re-indent the current
    selection (or the current line when nothing is selected), and
    pressing enter will, apart from inserting a line break,
    automatically indent the new line. Pressing control-enter will
    cause the whole buffer to be re-coloured, which can be helpful
    when some colouring has become out-of-date without the editor
    noticing it.</p>

    <p>The editor sports an undo/redo system, accessible with
    control-z (undo) and control-y (redo). Safari will not allow
    client scripts to capture control-z presses, but you can use
    control-backspace instead on that browser.</p>

    <p>The key-combination control-[ triggers a paren-blink: If the
    cursor is directly after a '(', ')', '[', ']', '{', or '}', the
    editor looks for the matching character, and highlights these
    characters for a moment. There is an option to enable this to
    happen any time the user types something or moves the cursor.</p>

    <p>To use CodeMirror in a document, you should add a script tag to
    load <a href="js/codemirror.js"><code>codemirror.js</code></a>. This
    adds two objects to your environment, <code>CodeMirror</code> and
    <code>CodeMirrorConfig</code>. The first is the interface to the
    editor, the second can be used to configure it. (Note that this is
    the only name-space pollution you can expect from CodeMirror --
    all other cruft is kept inside the IFRAMEs that it creates when
    you open an editor.)</p>

    <p>To add an editor to a document, you must choose a place, a
    parser, and a style-sheet for it. For example, to append an
    XML editor to the body of the document, you do:</p>

    <pre class="code">var editor = new CodeMirror(document.body, {
  parserfile: "parsexml.js",
  stylesheet: "xmlcolors.css"
});</pre>

    <p>The first argument to the <code>CodeMirror</code> constructor
    can be a DOM node, in which case the editor gets appended to that
    node, or a function, which will be called with the IFRAME node as
    argument, and which is expected to place that node somewhere in
    the document.</p>

    <p>The second (optional) argument is an object that specifies
    options. A set of default options (see below) is present in the
    <code>CodeMirrorConfig</code> object, but each instance of the
    editor can be given a set of specific options to override these
    defaults. In this case, we specified that the parser should be
    loaded from the <a
    href="js/parsexml.js"><code>"parsexml.js"</code></a> file, and
    that <a href="css/xmlcolors.css"><code>"xmlcolors.css"</code></a>
    should be used to specify the colours of the code.</p>

    <p>Another example:</p>

    <pre class="code">var editor = new CodeMirror(CodeMirror.replace("inputfield"), {
  parserfile: ["tokenizejavascript.js", "parsejavascript.js"],
  path: "lib/codemirror/js/",
  stylesheet: "lib/codemirror/css/jscolors.css",
  content: document.getElementById("inputfield").value
});</pre>

    <p>Here we use the utility function
    <code>CodeMirror.replace</code> to create a function that will
    replace a node in the current document (given either directly or
    by ID) with the editor. We also select the JavaScript parser this
    time, and give a <code>path</code> option to tell the editor that
    its files are not located in the same directory as the current
    HTML page, but in <code>"lib/codemirror/"</code>.</p>

    <p>There is a function
    <code>CodeMirror.isProbablySupported()</code> that causes some
    1998-style browser detection to happen, returning
    <code>false</code> if CodeMirror is probably not supported on the
    browser, <code>true</code> if it probably is, and
    <code>null</code> if it has no idea. As the name suggests, this is
    not something you can rely on, but it's usually better than
    nothing.</p>

    <p>Another utility function, <code>CodeMirror.fromTextArea</code>,
    will, given a textarea node or the id of such a node, hide the
    textarea and replace it with a CodeMirror frame. If the textarea
    was part of a form, an <code>onsubmit</code> handler will be
    registered with this form, which will load the content of the
    editor into the textarea, so that it can be submitted as normal.
    This function optionally takes a configuration object as second
    argument.</p>

    <pre class="code">var editor = CodeMirror.fromTextArea("inputfield", {
  parserfile: ["tokenizejavascript.js", "parsejavascript.js"],
  path: "lib/codemirror/js/",
  stylesheet: "lib/codemirror/css/jscolors.css"
});</pre>

    <p>Instances created like this will have a
    <code>toTextArea()</code> method which removes them and restores
    the text area they were based on, and a <code>save()</code> method
    which simply updates the textarea with the content of the
    editor.</p>

    <p>The reason that the script path has to be configured is that
    CodeMirror will load in a bunch of extra files when an editor is
    created (the parser script, among others). To be able to do this,
    it has to know where to find them. These are all the JavaScript
    files that are part of CodeMirror itself:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><a href="js/codemirror.js"><code>codemirror.js</code></a></dt>
      <dd>Main interface, takes care of default configuration and the
      definition of editor frames. Include this in your HTML
      document.</dd>
      <dt><a href="js/editor.js"><code>editor.js</code></a></dt> <dd>The
      code that takes care of reacting to user input, colouring text,
      and indenting lines.</dd>
      <dt><a href="js/util.js"><code>util.js</code></a></dt> <dd>A few
      generic utility functions.</dd>
      <dt><a
      href="js/undo.js"><code>undo.js</code></a></dt>
      <dd>Implements the undo history for the editor.</dd>
      <dt><a
      href="js/stringstream.js"><code>stringstream.js</code></a></dt>
      <dd>Objects for wrapping the textual input to the parser.</dd>
      <dt><a href="js/select.js"><code>select.js</code></a></dt> <dd>Some
      helper utilities for working with selected text and cursor
      positions.</dd>
      <dt><a href="js/tokenize.js"><code>tokenize.js</code></a></dt>
      <dd>Helper framework for writing tokenisers.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Most of these are rather full of comments, which can be useful
    when you are trying to figure out how they work, but wastes a lot
    of bandwidth in a production system. Take a look at the
    description of the <code>basefiles</code> option below if you want
    to concatenate and minimise the library (see the <a href="compress.html">compression API</a>).</p>

    <p>Apart from these, there are files that implement the various
    parsers. These all start with either <code>parse</code> or
    <code>tokenize</code>.</p>

    <h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

    <p>There are three ways to configure CodeMirror:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If you define a global <code>CodeMirrorConfig</code> object
      before loading <a
      href="js/codemirror.js"><code>codemirror.js</code></a>, the
      configuration options in that object will override the
      defaults.</li>
      <li>By assigning to the properties of the
      <code>CodeMirrorConfig</code> object, configuration defaults can
      be overridden after loading <a
      href="js/codemirror.js"><code>codemirror.js</code></a>.</li>
      <li>The <code>CodeMirror</code> constructor can be given a second
      argument, an object, which will override some options for just
      that editor. Options not mentioned in this object will default to
      the values in the <code>CodeMirrorConfig</code> object.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The options that can be specified are these (most have sensible
    defaults specified in <a
    href="js/codemirror.js"><code>codemirror.js</code></a>):</p>

    <dl>

      <dt><code>stylesheet</code></dt><dd>The file name of the
      style-sheet, or style-sheets, that should be used to colour the
      code in the editor frame. Can be a string or an array of
      strings. See <a
      href="css/jscolors.css"><code>jscolors.css</code></a> for an
      example. The set of active stylesheets can be changed in a
      running editor with the <code>setStylesheet</code> method, which
      also takes a string or array of strings as argument.</dd>

      <dt><code>path</code></dt><dd>The path that is prefixed to
      script file names when they are loaded into an IFRAME. (Note that
      this is not applied to the style-sheet file name.)</dd>

      <dt><code>parserfile</code></dt><dd>A file name string, or an
      array of strings that name the files containing the parser. See
      below for the interface that such a parser should
      implement.</dd>

      <dt><code>basefiles</code></dt><dd>An array of strings naming
      the files containing the base CodeMirror functionality. Defaults
      to <code>["util.js", "stringstream.js", "select.js", "undo.js",
      "editor.js", "tokenize.js"]</code>, but if you put them all into
      a single file to reduce latency, or add some functionality, you
      might have to adjust that.</dd>

      <dt><code>iframeClass</code></dt><dd>Set this to a string to
      give the IFRAME node created for the editor a custom CSS class.
      Defaults to <code>null</code>.</dd>
      
      <dt><code>passDelay</code></dt><dd>Gives the amount of
      milliseconds between colouring passes. Defaults to 200.</dd>

      <dt><code>passTime</code></dt><dd>Specifies the maximum amount
      of time that the highlighter will spend in one shot. Setting
      this too high will cause the editor to 'freeze' the browser for
      noticeable intervals. Defaults to 50.</dd>

      <dt><code>continuousScanning</code></dt><dd>Configure continuous
      scanning of the document. When <code>false</code>, scanning is
      disabled. When set to a number, say <code>N</code>, a
      'background' process will scan the document for
      <code>passTime</code> (see above) milliseconds every
      <code>N</code> milliseconds, regardless of whether anything
      changed. This makes sure non-local changes propagate through the
      document, and will help keep everything consistent. It does add
      extra processing cost, even for an idle editor. Default value is
      <code>false</code>.</dd>

      <dt><code>autoMatchParens</code></dt><dd>When <code>true</code>,
      will cause parens to be matched every time a key is pressed or
      the user clicks on the document. Defaults to <code>false</code>.
      Might be expensive for big documents.</dd>

      <dt><code>markParen</code>,<code>unmarkParen</code></dt>
      <dd>Can be used to customise the way brackets are marked (and
      unmarked) when matched. The simplest way to do this is to simply
      set <code>markParen</code> to a string, the name of the CSS
      class that should be added to the bracket elements when they are
      matched. Alternatively, you can provide an array of two strings,
      where the first will be used for successful matches, and the
      second for failing matches. You'll have to include some CSS file
      (using the <code>stylesheet</code> option) that defines these
      classes. Alternatively, you can provide both
      <code>markParen</code> and <code>unmarkParen</code>, and set
      them to functions that will be called to style the bracket's
      <code>SPAN</code> elements. Both will get this element as their
      first argument, and <code>markParen</code> gets a second boolean
      argument indicating whether a successful match was found. The
      default behaviour, if these options are not supplied, is to make
      the brackets bold and green (or red, if not matched).</dd>

      <dt><code>saveFunction</code></dt><dd>If given a function
      value, that function will be invoked when the user presses
      control-s. You should advise your Opera users to use
      control-shift-s instead, since plain control-s will bring up the
      'save page' dialog. Defaults to <code>null</code>.</dd>

      <dt><code>undoDepth</code></dt><dd>Maximum length of the undo
      history. Default is 50. This setting is changeable with the
      <code>setUndoDepth(depth)</code> method on CodeMirror
      instances.</dd>

      <dt><code>onChange</code></dt><dd>An optional function of zero
      arguments that gets called whenever the document is changed.
      Happens at undo-commit time, not instantaniously.</dd>

      <dt><code>undoDelay</code></dt><dd>When nothing is done in the
      editor for this amount of milliseconds, pending changes get
      added to the undo history. Setting this lower will give the undo
      functionality a finer granularity. Defaults to 800.</dd>

      <dt><code>width</code>, <code>height</code></dt><dd>The size of
      the editor frame, given as a style-sheet quantities (for example
      <code>"600px"</code> or <code>"100%"</code>). When
      <code>height</code> is set to <code>dynamic</code>, the editor
      will automatically resize to fit its contents. In this case, the
      <code>minHeight</code> option (an integer) is used to determine
      the minimum height in pixels.</dd>

      <dt><code>disableSpellcheck</code></dt><dd>Should the editor
      disable spell-checking on browsers that support it (Firefox 2+).
      Default is <code>true</code>, since for most code spell-checking
      is useless. Can be changed with the
      <code>setSpellCheck(on)</code> method.</dd>

      <dt><code>textWrapping</code></dt><dd>Can be used to disable or
      enable text-wrapping in the editor frame. Default is
      <code>true</code>. Changeable with the
      <code>setTextWrapping(on)</code> method.</dd>

      <dt><code>lineNumbers</code></dt><dd>Show line numbers to the
      left of the editor. This requires you to specify a style for the
      <code>CodeMirror-line-numbers</code> CSS class (in the outer
      document) to configure the width, font, colors, etcetera for the
      line-number DIV. You have to make sure that lines in the
      numbering element have the same height as lines in the editor.
      This is most easily done by giving them both the same font and
      an absolute ('pt' or 'px') font size. This option defaults to
      <code>false</code>. Changeable with the
      <code>setLineNumbers(on)</code> method.</dd>

      <dt><code>firstLineNumber</code></dt><dd>When
      <code>lineNumbers</code> is enabled, this determines the number
      given to the first line. Default is <code>1</code>.</dd>

      <dt><code>lineNumberDelay</code>,
      <code>lineNumberTime</code></dt><dd>When both line numbers are
      and text wrapping are turned on, updating line numbers can be
      expensive. These settings can be used to control how fast the
      updating happens &#x2015; they work in the same way as
      <code>passDelay</code> and <code>passTime</code>.</dd>

      <dt><code>onLineNumberClick</code></dt><dd>If given a function
      value, this function will be called when the user clicks a line
      number, with the number of the line and the DIV used to display
      that number as its arguments.</dd>

      <dt><code>styleNumbers</code></dt><dd>A (somewhat awkward) hook
      that allows your code to change the style of the line numbers
      for certain lines (to, for example, highlight them). Whenever
      the line numbers are updated, the function value given through
      this option is called with three arguments: <code>(numberDIV,
      lineNode, lineNum)</code>. It can then update the style of the
      <code>numberDIV</code> element based on either the BR node at
      the start of the line (<code>lineNode</code>, which is
      <code>null</code> for the first line), or the actual line number
      (<code>lineNum</code>). Note that it might get passed DIVs that
      were already styled before (the DIVs are reused), so it has to
      'reset' the style to the default for lines that don't need to be
      styled.</dd>

      <dt><code>indentUnit</code></dt><dd>An integer that specifies
      the amount of spaces one 'level' of indentation should add.
      Default is <code>2</code>. Changeable in a running editor using
      the <code>setIndentUnit(spaces)</code> method.</dd>

      <dt><code>tabMode</code></dt><dd>Determines what the effect of
      pressing tab is. Possibilities are:
      <dl>
        <dt><code>"indent"</code></dt><dd>The default. Causes tab to
        adjust the indentation of the selection or current line using
        the parser's rules.</dd>
        <dt><code>"spaces"</code></dt><dd>Pressing tab simply inserts
        four spaces.</dd>
        <dt><code>"default"</code></dt><dd>CodeMirror does not
        interfere with the tab key, but leaves it to the browser to
        handle it. Binds shift-space to regular indentation
        behaviour.</dd>
        <dt><code>"shift"</code></dt><dd>Pressing tab indents the
        current line (or selection) one <code>indentUnit</code>
        deeper, pressing shift-tab, un-indents it.</dd>
      </dl>
      This option can be changed at run-time using the
      <code>setTabMode(mode)</code> method.</dd>

      <dt><code>enterMode</code></dt><dd>Determines how a new line
      created by pressing enter is indented. Supported modes are:
      <dl>
        <dt><code>"indent"</code></dt><dd>The default. Causes the new
        line to be intented by the rules of the parser.</dd>
        <dt><code>"keep"</code></dt><dd>Keeps the indentation of the
        previous line.</dd>
        <dt><code>"flat"</code></dt><dd>Never indents new lines.</dd>
      </dl>
      The <code>setEnterMode</code> method can be used to change this
      option in a running editor.</dd>

      <dt><code>electricChars</code></dt><dd>A boolean that can be
      used to turn "electric chars" (characters that cause the current
      line to be reindented when typed, such as <code>{</code> and
      <code>}</code> in C-like languages) on and off. Default is
      on.</dd>

      <dt><code>reindentOnLoad</code></dt><dd>When <code>true</code>,
      this causes the content of the editor to be reindented
      immediately when the editor loads. Defaults to
      <code>false</code>.</dd>

      <dt><code>readOnly</code></dt><dd>When set to <code>true</code>,
      the document is not editable.</dd>

      <dt><code>domain</code></dt><dd>Can be set to the value
      <code>document.domain</code> should have inside of the iframe.
      Used to prevent access issues in IE, where this value isn't
      automatically inherited by iframes.</dd>

      <dt><code>noScriptCaching</code></dt><dd>The scripts loaded
      inside the editor frame are not affected by, for example,
      ctrl-F5 on Firefox, and will often be cached even though you
      don't want them to. During development, you can set this option
      to <code>true</code> to cause CodeMirror to add a changing dummy
      parameter to the script URLs, which will force browsers to
      reload them every time.</dd>

      <dt><code>onLoad</code></dt><dd>If set to a function, this
      will be called (with the editor object as its argument) after
      the editor has finished initialising.</dd>
      
      <dt><code>onCursorActivity</code></dt><dd>A function that is
      called every time the cursor moves, with the top-level node that
      the cursor is inside or next to as an argument. Can be used to
      have some controls react to the context of the cursor.</dd>

      <dt><code>activeTokens</code></dt><dd>Can be set to a function
      that will be called with <code>(spanNode, tokenObject,
      editor)</code> arguments whenever a new token node is being
      added to the document. Can be used to do things like add event
      handlers to nodes. Should <em>not</em> change the DOM structure
      of the node (so no turning the span into a link), since this
      will greatly confuse the editor.</dd>

      <dt id="parserConfig"><code>parserConfig</code></dt><dd>An
      object value that is passed along to the parser to configure it.
      What this object should look like depends on the parser
      used.</dd>

      <dt><code>content</code></dt><dd>The starting content of the
      editor. You'll probably not want to provide a global default for
      this, but add it to the <code>options</code> object passed to
      individual editors as they are created.</dd>

    </dl>

    <h2 id="parsers">Parsers</h2>

    <p>(If you want to use a CodeMirror parser to highlight a piece of
    text, without creating an editor, see <a
    href="highlight.html">this example</a>, and the <code><a
    href="js/highlight.js">highlight.js</a></code> script.)</p>

      HTML or XML, and things like self-closing tags (<code>br</code>,
      <code>img</code>) exist. This defaults to <code>true</code>.

    <h2 id="programming">Programming Interface</h2>

    <p>To be as flexible as possible, CodeMirror implements a very
    plain editable field, without any accompanying buttons, bells, and
    whistles. <code>CodeMirror</code> objects do, however, provide a
    number of methods and properties that make it possible to add
    extra functionality around the editor. <a
    href="js/mirrorframe.js"><code>mirrorframe.js</code></a> provides
    a basic example of their usage.</p>

    <h3 id="properties">Properties</h3>

    <dl>
      <dt><code>frame</code></dt><dd>The editable frame.</dd>
      <dt><code>win</code></dt><dd>The window of the editable frame.
      Mostly useful for attaching event handlers.</dd>
      <dt><code>wrapping</code></dt><dd>The <code>DIV</code> element
      wrapped around the frame. This always has a CSS class of
      <code>CodeMirror-wrapping</code>.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3 id="methods">Methods</h3>

    <dl>
      <dt><code>getCode()</code> &#8594;
      <code>string</code></dt><dd>Returns the current content of the
      editor, as a string.</dd>

      <dt><code>setCode(string)</code></dt><dd>Replaces the current
      content of the editor with the given value.</dd>

      <dt><code>focus()</code></dt><dd>Gives focus to the editor
      frame.</dd>

      <dt><code>selection()</code> &#8594;
      <code>string</code></dt><dd>Returns the text that is currently
      selected in the editor.</dd>

      <dt><code>replaceSelection(string)</code></dt><dd>Replaces the
      currently selected text with the given string. Will also cause
      the editor frame to gain focus.</dd>

      <dt><code>reindent()</code></dt><dd>Automatically re-indent the
      whole document.</dd>

      <dt><code>reindentSelection()</code></dt><dd>Automatically
      re-indent the selected lines.</dd>

      <dt><code>getSearchCursor(pattern, startPos, caseFold)</code>
      &#8594; <code>cursor</code></dt><dd>The first argument provides
      the pattern that should be searched for. It can be a string or a
      regular expression (with the caveat that regexps won't match
      across line boundaries, whereas strings will). The second
      determines where to start searching. It can
      be <code>false</code> (or left off) for the start of the
      document, <code>true</code> for the current cursor position, or
      a <code>{line, character}</code> object (as returned
      by <code>cursorPosition</code>, or created yourself using a line
      handle and a number) to set a random position. The third
      argument, a boolean, determines whether the search will be
      case-sensitive. If it is not provided, the search will only be
      case-sensitive if the search string contains uppercase
      characters. Returns an object that provides an interface for
      searching. Call its <code>findNext()</code> and
      <code>findPrevious()</code> methods to search for an occurrence.
      This returns <code>true</code> if something is found, or
      <code>false</code> if the end or start of the document was
      reached. When an occurrence has been found, you can call
      <code>select()</code> to select it, or
      <code>replace(string)</code> to replace it with a given string
      (you can use \1 placeholders in this string if you matched a
      regular expression). To find out where the match was found, call
      the <code>position()</code> method, which returns a <code>{line,
      character}</code> object. Note that letting the user change the
      document, or programmatically changing it in any way except for
      calling <code>replace</code> on the cursor itself, might cause a
      cursor object to skip back to the beginning of the
      document.</dd>

      <dt><code>undo()</code></dt><dd>Undo one changeset, if available.</dd>
      <dt><code>redo()</code></dt><dd>Redo one changeset, if available.</dd>
      <dt><code>historySize() &#8594; object</code></dt><dd>Get a
      <code>{undo, redo}</code> object holding the sizes of the undo
      and redo histories.</dd>
      <dt><code>clearHistory()</code></dt><dd>Drop all history
      information.</dd>

      <dt><code>grabKeys(callback, filter)</code></dt><dd>Route
      keyboard input in the editor to a callback function. This
      function is given a slightly normalised (see
      <code>normalizeEvent</code> in <a
      href="js/util.js"><code>util.js</code></a>) <code>keydown</code>
      event object. If a second argument is given, this will be used
      to determine which events to apply the callback to. It should
      take a key code (as in <code>event.keyCode</code>), and return a
      boolean, where <code>true</code> means the event should be
      routed to the callback, and <code>false</code> leaves the key to
      perform its normal behaviour.</dd>
      <dt><code>ungrabKeys()</code></dt><dd>Revert the effect of
      <code>grabKeys</code>.</dd>

      <dt><code>setParser(name, parserConfig)</code></dt><dd>Change
      the active parser. To use this you'll have to load more than one
      parser (put the one you want to use as default at the end of the
      list). Then call this function with a string containing the name
      of the parser you want to switch to (see the parser script file
      to find the name, it'll be something like
      <code>CSSParser</code>). The second argument is optional, and
      can be used to pass a new parser configuration object.</dd>

      <dt><code>cursorCoords(start)</code></dt><dd>Get the coordinates
      of the cursor in the editor, relative to the top-left corner of
      the outer document. Normally returns an object with
      <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>yBot</code> (the
      bottom of the cursor) properties. May return <code>null</code>
      if the cursor position could not be determined (for example, if
      the editor is not focused).</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3 id="lines">Line Manipulation</h3>

    <p>For detailed interaction with the content of the editor,
    CodeMirror exposes a line-oriented interface, which allows you to
    inspect and manipulate the document line by line. Line handles
    should be considered opaque (they are in fact the <code>BR</code>
    nodes at the start of the line), except that the value
    <code>false</code> (but <em>not</em> <code>null</code>) always
    denotes an invalid value. Since changing the document might cause
    some line handles to become invalid, every function that takes
    them as argument can throw
    <code>CodeMirror.InvalidLineHandle</code>. These are the relevant
    methods:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><code>cursorPosition(start)</code> &#8594;
      <code>object</code></dt><dd>Retrieve a <code>{line,
      character}</code> object representing the cursor position.
      <code>start</code> defaults to <code>true</code> and determines
      if the startpoint or the endpoint of the selection is used.</dd>
      <dt><code>cursorLine()</code> &#8594;
      <code>handle</code></dt><dd>Returns the line on which the cursor
      is currently sitting.</dd>
      <dt><code>firstLine()</code> &#8594;
      <code>handle</code></dt><dd>Get the first line of the
      document.</dd>
      <dt><code>lastLine()</code> &#8594;
      <code>handle</code></dt><dd>The last line.</dd>
      <dt><code>nextLine(handle)</code> &#8594;
      <code>handle</code></dt><dd>Get the line after the given one, or
      <code>false</code> if that was the last line.</dd>
      <dt><code>prevLine(handle)</code> &#8594;
      <code>handle</code></dt><dd>Find the line before the given one,
      return <code>false</code> if that was the first line.</dd>
      <dt><code>nthLine(number)</code> &#8594;
      <code>handle</code></dt><dd>Find the Nth line of the document.
      Note that the first line counts as one, not zero. Returns
      <code>false</code> if there is no such line.</dd>
      <dt><code>lineContent(handle)</code> &#8594;
      <code>string</code></dt><dd>Retrieve the content of the
      line.</dd>
      <dt><code>setLineContent(handle, string)</code></dt><dd>Replace
      the content of the line with the given string.</dd>
      <dt><code>removeLine(handle)</code></dt><dd>Remove the given
      line from the editor. The handle will stay valid after this
      operation, and now refers to the next line.</dd>
      <dt><code>lineNumber(handle)</code> &#8594;
      <code>number</code></dt><dd>Ask which line of the document
      (1-based) the given line is.</dd>
      <dt><code>jumpToLine(handle)</code></dt><dd>Moves the cursor to
      the start of the given line.</dd>
      <dt><code>selectLines(startHandle, startOffset,
      endHandle, endOffset)</code></dt><dd>Move the selection to a
      specific point. <code>endHandle</code> and
      <code>endOffset</code> can be omitted to just place the cursor
      somewhere without selecting any text.</dd>
      <dt><code>insertIntoLine(handle, position,
      text)</code></dt><dd>Insert a piece of text into a line.
      <code>position</code> can be an integer, specifying the position
      in the line where the text should be inserted, or the string
      <code>"end"</code>, for the end of the line.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2 id="writeparser">Writing a Parser</h2>

    <p>A parser is implemented by one or more files (see
    <code>parserfile</code> above) which, when loaded, add a
    <code>Parser</code> property to the <code>Editor</code> object
    defined by <a href="js/editor.js"><code>editor.js</code></a>. This
    object must support the following interface:</p>

    <dl>

      <dt><code>make(stream)</code></dt><dd>A function that, given a
      string stream (see <a
      href="js/stringstream.js"><code>stringstream.js</code></a>),
      creates a parser. The behaviour of this parser is described
      below.</dd>

      <dt><code>electricChars</code></dt><dd>An optional string
      containing the characters that, when typed, should cause the
      indentation of the current line to be recomputed (for example
      <code>"{}"</code> for c-like languages).</dd>

      <dt><code>configure(object)</code></dt><dd>An optional function
      that can be used to configure the parser. If it exists, and an
      editor is given a <code>parserConfig</code> option, it will be
      called with the value of that option.</dd>

      <dt><code>firstIndentation(chars, current,
      direction)</code></dt><dd>An optional function that is used to
      determine the proper indentation of the first line of a
      document. When not provided, <code>0</code> is used.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>When the <code>make</code> method is called with a string
    stream, it should return a MochiKit-style iterator: an object with
    a <code>next</code> method, which will raise
    <code>StopIteration</code> when it is at its end (see <a
    href="http://bob.pythonmac.org/archives/2005/07/06/iteration-in-javascript/">this</a>
    for details). This iterator, when called, will consume input from
    the string stream, and produce a token object.</p>

    <p>Token objects represent a single significant piece of the text
    that is being edited. A token object must have a
    <code>value</code> property holding the text it stands for, and a
    <code>style</code> property with the CSS class that should be used
    to colour this element. This can be anything, except that any
    whitespace at the start of a line should <em>always</em> have
    class <code>"whitespace"</code>: The editor must be able to
    recognize these when it indents lines. Furthermore, each newline
    character <em>must</em> have its own separate token, which has an
    <code>indentation</code> property holding a function that can be
    used to determine the proper indentation level for the next line.
    This function optionally takes the text in the first token of the
    next line, the current indentation of the line, and the
    'direction' of the indentation as arguments, which it can use to
    adjust the indentation level. The direction argument is only
    useful for modes in which lines do not have a fixed indentation,
    and can be modified by multiple tab presses. It is
    <code>null</code> for 'default' indentations (like what happens
    when the user presses enter), <code>true</code> for regular tab
    presses, and <code>false</code> for control-tab or shift-tab.</p>

    <p>So far this should be pretty easy. The hard part is that this
    iterator must also have a <code>copy</code> method. This method,
    called without arguments, returns a function representing the
    current state of the parser. When this state function is later
    called with a string stream as its argument, it returns a parser
    object that resumes parsing using the old state and the new input
    stream. It may assume that only one parser is active at a time,
    and can clobber the state of the old parser if it wants.</p>

    <p>For examples, see <a
    href="js/parsejavascript.js"><code>parsejavascript.js</code></a>,
    <a href="js/parsexml.js"><code>parsexml.js</code></a>, and <a
    href="js/parsecss.js"><code>parsecss.js</code></a>.</p>
