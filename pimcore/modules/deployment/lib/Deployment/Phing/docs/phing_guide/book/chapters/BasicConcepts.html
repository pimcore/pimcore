	<h1>
		<a name="BasicConcepts"></a>Basic Concepts
	</h1>

	<p>Technically Phing uses a layered model to perform its actions.
		The following section briefly describes the layers used by Phing. If
		you're only a user who does not want to extend Phing or are not
		interested in the interior of Phing you can safely skip this chapter.</p>

	<h2>
		<a name="InitLayer"></a>The Init Layer
	</h2>

	<p>The Init Layer sets up the working environment for Phing. It
		provides core services like the Logger, a Timer, a file I/O API and so
		forth. For the technical details on Init see the chapter about
		developing with Phing. Basically the Init Layer consists of various
		different file located in different places:</p>

	<p>The exact files and techniques used for the init process are not
		discussed in this chapter. To get a brief idea simply browse the files
		mentioned above. More detailed insights to the matter are given in:
		[REF].</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="EnvironmentAndPackageSupport"></a>Environment And Package
		Support
	</h3>

	<p>
		Phing needs to find some files and constants that are accessible
		throughout the system. First of all it determines the system
		environment variables that have to be set during the installation of
		Phing. See <a href="Setup.html">Setting up Phing</a> for more
		information on setting up Phing. If this very essential variables can
		not be found or guessed the program terminates with a proper error
		message. We assume everything is set-up properly and the
		initialization of paths and constants went fine.
	</p>

	<p>The system uses a generalized package support, similar to the
		Java package support to locate and include required source files. This
		package support must be set-up properly so Phing finds all the files
		it needs. The Init Layer does this for you given your environment
		variables are set properly.</p>

	<p>To put it in a nutshell, the Init Layer</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Checks your Phing environment variables and makes them
			accessible within the Phing application.</li>
		<li>Provides you with several core services like:
			<ul>
				<li>File API</li>
				<li>Logging system</li>
				<li>Exception system</li>
				<li>Event system</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Provides you with tools to include files using dot-path
			notation similar to Java's</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>
		<a name="PhingLayer"></a>The Phing Layer
	</h2>

	<p>
		While the parts of the system layer might be useful for other
		applications, too, the <em>Phing Layer</em> provides you with several
		modules that only make sense within Phing. The modules in this layer
		use the first layer to throw exceptions, etc., so this one is on top
		of Init Layer.
	</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="SpecializedInitComponents"></a>Specialized Init Components
	</h3>

	<p>First, the Phing Layer contains classes derived from some of
		those in Init Layer, like:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Logger for Projects</li>
		<li>Exception subclasses for the errors that may occur during the
			Phing build process.</li>
		<li>Phing Events and Listeners</li>
		<li>More Complex File API</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>
		<a name="PhingTypes"></a>Phing Project Component Classes
	</h3>

	<p>Second, the Phing Layer provides you with base classes for
		Projects and the &quot;things&quot; in projects: Targets, Tasks and
		Types. Phing always operates on one project that contains Targets,
		Tasks and Types.</p>

	<p>
		Tasks are &quot;pieces of code&quot; that are executed. They are
		implemented as classes. See <a href="ExtendingPhing.html">Extending
			Phing</a> for details. Types are essentially the different type of
		variables that are available to be used within tasks. These types may
		be complex (filesets, etc.) or simply a wrapper for key/value pairs.
		Targets are &quot;chunks of tasks and types&quot; that have a unique
		name -- sorta like functions/methods.
	</p>

	<p>
		Every project has a default target that is executed, if no target to
		execute is given to Phing, but you can call other targets from the
		command line, too. Targets may <em>depend</em> on each other, e.g. if
		Target A depends on Target B, Phing will execute B before A.
	</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="BuildFileParser"></a>The Build File Parser
	</h3>

	<p>
		So, but how to define these Projects and their components? Well, the
		answer is: We define them within a <em>build file</em>. What format to
		chose? Because build files have a hierarchical structure -- Projects
		containing targets, containing tasks etc. -- they are written in XML.
	</p>

	<p>
		These XML files have to be parsed. For that, the Phing Layer provides
		an XML parser that is give a list that maps tag names to classes. So,
		for example, <em>ProjectParser</em> knows, the <em>&lt;property&gt;</em>
		Tag and the information defined in it is handled by <em>phing.tasks.system.PropertyTask</em>.
	</p>

	<p>
		For more information regarding the Parser and the parsing process and
		how to write your own files, please see <a href="ExtendingPhing.html">Extending
			Phing</a>.
