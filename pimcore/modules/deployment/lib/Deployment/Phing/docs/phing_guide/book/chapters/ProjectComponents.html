	<h1>Project Components</h1>

	<p>This goal of this chapter is to make you familiar with the basic
		components of a buildfile. After reading this chapter, you should be
		able to read and understand the basic structure of any buildfile even
		if you don't know exactly what the individual pieces do.</p>
	<p>
		For supplemental reference information, you should see <a
			href="appendixes/AppendixB-CoreTasks.html">Appendix B</a>, <a
			href="appendixes/AppendixD-CoreTypes.html">Appendix D</a> and <a
			href="appendixes/AppendixE-ProjectComponents.html">Appendix E</a>.
	</p>

	<h2>
		<a name="Projects"></a>Projects
	</h2>

	<p>
		In the structure of a Phing buildfile, there must be exactly one <em>Project</em>
		defined; the <em>&lt;project&gt; </em>tag is the root element of the
		buildfile, meaning that everything else in the buildfile is contained
		within the <em>&lt;project</em> &gt; element.
	</p>

	<pre title="An Example for the use of Projects">
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;

&lt;project name=&quot;test&quot; description=&quot;Simple test build file&quot; default=&quot;main&quot; &gt;
  &lt;!-- Everything else here --&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
</pre>

	<p>
		The listing above shows a sample <em>&lt;project&gt;</em> tag that has
		all attributes available for Projects. The <em>name</em> and <em>description</em>
		attributes are fairly self-explanatory; the <em>default</em> attribute
		specifies the default <em>Target</em> to execute if no target is
		specified (<a href="#Target">Targets</a> are described below). For a
		complete reference, see <a
			href="appendixes/AppendixE-ProjectComponents.html#Project">Appendix
			E</a>.
	</p>

	<h2>
		<a name="Version"></a>Version
	</h2>

	<p>
		Since Phing 2.4.2 it is possible to include a <em>phingVersion</em>
		attribute in the <em>&lt;project&gt;</em> tag. This attribute allows
		you to define the minimum Phing version required to execute a build
		file, in order to prevent compatibility issues.
	</p>

	<pre title="An Example for the use of the Version attribute">
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;

&lt;project name=&quot;test&quot; phingVersion=&quot;2.4.2&quot; &gt;
  &lt;!-- Everything else here --&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
</pre>

	<h2>
		<a name="ComponentsInGeneral"></a>Project Components in General
	</h2>

	<p>
		Project Components are all the elements found inside a project, i.e.
		targets, tasks, types, etc. Project components may have attributes and
		nested tags. Attributes only contain simple values, i.e. strings,
		integers etc. Nested elements may be complex Phing types (like
		FileSets) or simple wrapper classes for values with custom keys (see <a
			href="appendixes/AppendixD-CoreTypes.html#Fileset">FileSet</a> for
		example).
	</p>

	<p>
		Any nested elements must be supported by the class that implements the
		project component, and because the nested tags are handled by the
		project component class the same nested tag may have different
		meanings (and different attributes) depending on the context. So, for
		example, the nested tag <em>&lt;param</em>.../&gt; within the <em>&lt;phingcall&gt;</em>
		tag is handled very differently from the<em>&lt;param.../&gt;</em> tag
		within the <em>&lt;xsltfilter&gt;</em> tag -- in the first case
		setting project properties, in the second case setting XSLT
		parameters.
	</p>

	<h2>
		<a name="Targets"></a>Targets
	</h2>

	<p>
		Targets are collections of project components (but not other targets)
		that are assigned a unique name within their project. A target
		generally performs a specific task -- or calls other targets that
		perform specific tasks -- and therefore a target is a bit like a <em>
			function</em> (but a target has no return value).
	</p>
	<p>
		Targets may <em>depend</em> on other targets. For example, if target A
		depends on a target B, then when target A is called to be executed,
		target B will be executed first. Phing automatically resolves these
		dependencies. You cannot have circular references like: &quot;target A
		depends on target B that depends on target A&quot;.
	</p>

	<p>The following code snippet shows an example of the use of
		targets.</p>

	<pre title="Simple target">
&lt;target name=&quot;othertask&quot; depends=&quot;buildpage&quot; description=&quot;Whatever&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!-- Task calls here --&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;

&lt;target name=&quot;buildpage&quot; description=&quot;Some description&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!-- Task calls here --&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;
</pre>

	<p>
		When Phing is asked to execute the <em>othertask</em> target, it will
		see the dependency and execute <em>buildpage </em>first. Notice that
		the the dependency task can be defined after the dependent task.
	</p>

	<h2>
		<a name="Tasks"></a>Tasks
	</h2>

	<p>
		Tasks are responsible for doing the work in Phing. Basically, tasks
		are the individual actions that your buildfile can perform. For
		example, tasks exist to copy a file, create a directory, TAR files in
		a directory. Tasks may also be more complex such as XsltTask which
		copies a file and transforms the file using XSLT, SmartyTask which
		does something similar using Smarty templates, or CreoleTask which
		executes SQL statements against a specified DB. See <a
			href="appendixes/AppendixB-CoreTasks.html#XsltTask">Appendix B</a>
		for descriptions of Phing tasks.
	</p>

	<p>Tasks support parameters in the form of:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Simple parameters (i.e. strings) passed as XML attributes, or</li>
		<li>More complex parameters that are passed by nested tags</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Simple parameters are basically strings. For example, if you pass a
		value <em>&quot;A simple string.&quot;</em> as a parameter, it is
		evaluated as a string and accessible as one. You can also reference
		properties as described in <a
			href="GettingStarted.html#PropertyElement">Getting Started</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		<em>Note:</em> There are special values that are not mapped to
		strings, but to boolean values instead. The values <em>true</em>, <em>false</em>,
		<em>yes</em>, <em>no</em>, <em>on</em> and <em>off</em> are translated
		to true/false boolean values.
	</p>

	<pre title="Simple parameter example">&lt;property name=&quot;myprop&quot; value=&quot;value&quot; override=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;</pre>
	<p>
		However, some tasks support more complex data types as parameters.
		These are passed to the task with <em>nested tags</em>. Consider the
		following example:
	</p>

	<pre title="Example for a task with complex parameters">
&lt;copy&gt;
  &lt;fileset dir=&quot;.&quot;&gt;
    &lt;include name=&quot;**&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/fileset&gt;
&lt;/copy&gt;
</pre>

	<p>
		Here, <em>CopyTask</em> is passed a complex parameter, a Fileset.
		Tasks may support multiple complex types in addition to simple
		parameters. Note that the names of the nested tags used to create the
		complex types depend on the task implementation. Tasks may support
		default Phing types (see <a href="#Types">below</a>) or may introduce
		other types, for example to wrap key/value pairs.
	</p>

	<p>
		Refer to <a href="appendixes/AppendixB-CoreTasks.html">Appendix B</a>
		for a list of system tasks and their parameters.
	</p>

	<h2>
		<a name="Types"></a>Types
	</h2>

	<h3>
		<a name="TypesBasics"></a>Basics
	</h3>

	<p>
		Besides the simple types (strings, integer, booleans) you can use in
		the parameters of tasks, there are more complex Phing <em>Types</em>.
		As mentioned above, they are passed to a task by using nesting tags:
	</p>

	<pre>
&lt;task&gt;
  &lt;type /&gt;
&lt;/task&gt;

&lt;!-- or: --&gt;

&lt;task&gt;
  &lt;type1&gt;
    &lt;subtype1&gt;
      &lt;!-- etc. --&gt;
    &lt;/subtype1&gt;
  &lt;/type1&gt;
&lt;/task&gt;
</pre>

	<p>Note that types may consist of multiple nested tags -- and
		multiple levels of nested tags, as you can see in the second task call
		above.</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="TypesReferencing"></a>Referencing Types
	</h3>

	<p>
		An additional fact about types you should notice is the possibility of
		<em>referencing</em> type instances, i.e. you define your type
		somewhere in your build file and assign an id to it. Later, you can
		refer to that type by the id you assigned. Example:
	</p>

	<pre>
&lt;project&gt;
  &lt;fileset id=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;
    &lt;include name=&quot;*.php&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/fileset&gt;

  &lt;!-- Target that uses the type --&gt;
  &lt;target name=&quot;foo&quot; &gt;
    &lt;copy todir=&quot;/tmp&quot;&gt;
      &lt;fileset refid=&quot;foo&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/copy&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
</pre>

	<p>
		As you can see, the type instance is assigned an id with the <em>id</em>
		attribute and later on called by passing a plain <em>fileset</em> tag
		to <em>CopyTask</em> that only contains the <em>refid</em> attribute.
	</p>

	<h2>
		<a name="BasicTypes"></a>Basic Types
	</h2>

	<p>
		The following section gives you a quick introduction into the basic
		Phing types. For a complete reference see <a
			href="appendixes/AppendixD-CoreTypes.html">Appendix D</a>.
	</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="FileSet"></a>FileSet
	</h3>

	<p>FileSets are groups of files. You can include or exclude
		specific files and patterns to/from a FileSet. The use of patterns is
		explained below. For a start, look at the following example:</p>

	<pre>
&lt;fileset dir=&quot;/tmp&quot; id=&quot;fileset1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;include name=&quot;sometemp/file.txt&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;include name=&quot;othertemp/**&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;exclude name=&quot;othertemp/file.txt&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/fileset&gt;

&lt;fileset dir=&quot;/home&quot; id=&quot;fileset2&quot;&gt;
  &lt;include name=&quot;foo/**&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;include name=&quot;bar/**/*.php&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;exclude name=&quot;foo/tmp/**&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/fileset&gt;
</pre>

	<p>
		The use of patterns is quite straightforward: If you simply want to
		match a part of a filename or dirname, you use <strong>*</strong>. If
		you want to include multiple directories and/or files, you use <strong>**</strong>.
		This way, filesets provide an easy but powerful way to include files.
	</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="FileList"></a>FileList
	</h3>
	<p>FileLists, like FileSets, are collections of files; however, a
		FileList is an explicitly defined list of files -- and the files don't
		necessarily have to exist on the filesystem.</p>
	<p>
		Besides being able to refer to nonexistent files, another thing that
		FileLists allow you to do is specify files <em>in a certain order</em>.
		Files in FileSets are ordered based on the OS-level directory listing
		functions, in some cases you may want to specify a list of files to be
		processed in a certain order -- e.g. when concatenating files using
		the <em>&lt;append&gt;</em> task.
	</p>
	<pre title="FileList example">&lt;filelist dir=&quot;base/&quot; files=&quot;file1.txt,file2.txt,file3.txt&quot;/&gt;

&lt;!-- OR: --&gt;
&lt;filelist dir=&quot;basedir/&quot; listfile=&quot;files_to_process.txt&quot;/&gt;</pre>

	<h4>
		<a name="FilterchainsFilters"></a>FilterChains and Filters
	</h4>

	<p>
		FilterChains can be compared to Unix pipes. Unix pipes add a great
		deal of flexibility to command line operations; for example, if you
		wanted to copy just those lines that contained the string <em>blee</em>
		from the first 10 lines of a file called <em>foo</em> to a file called
		<em>bar</em>, you could do:
	</p>

	<pre>
cat foo | head -n10 | grep blee &gt; bar
</pre>

	<p>
		Something like this is not possible with the tasks and types that we
		have learned about thus far, and this is where the incredible
		usefulness of <em>FilterChains</em> becomes apparent. They emulate
		Unix pipes and provide a powerful dimension of file/stream
		manipulation for the tasks that support them.
	</p>

	<p>
		FilterChain usage is quite straightforward: you pass the complex Phing
		type <em>filterchain</em> to a task that supports FilterChains and add
		individual filters to the FilterChain. In the course of executing the
		task, the filters are applied (in the order in which they appear in
		the XML) to the contents of the files that are being manipulated by
		your task.
	</p>

	<pre>
&lt;filterchain&gt;
  &lt;replacetokens&gt;
    &lt;token key=&quot;BC_PATH&quot; value=&quot;${top.builddir}/&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;token key=&quot;BC_PATH_USER&quot; value=&quot;${top.builddir}/testsite/user/${lang}/&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/replacetokens&gt;

  &lt;filterreader classname=&quot;phing.filters.TailFilter&quot;&gt;
    &lt;param name=&quot;lines&quot; value=&quot;10&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/filterreader&gt;
&lt;/filterchain&gt;
</pre>
	<p>
		The code listing above shows you some example of how to use filter
		chains. For a complete reference see <a
			href="appendixes/AppendixD-CoreTypes.html#Filters">Appendix D</a>.
		This filter chain would replace all occurences of <em>BC_PATH</em> and
		<em>BC_PATH_USER</em> with the values assigned to them in lines 4 and
		5. Additionally, it will only return the last 10 lines of the files.
	</p>
	<p>Notice above that FilterChain filters have a
		&quot;shorthand&quot; notation and a long, generic notation. Most
		filters can be described using both of these forms:</p>
	<pre title="Filter shorthand / longhand comparison">&lt;replacetokens&gt;
  &lt;token key=&quot;BC_PATH&quot; value=&quot;${top.builddir}/&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;token key=&quot;BC_PATH_USER&quot; value=&quot;${top.builddir}/testsite/user/${lang}/&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/replacetokens&gt;

&lt;!-- OR: --&gt;

&lt;filterreader classname=&quot;phing.filters.ReplaceTokens&quot;&gt;
  &lt;param type=&quot;token&quot; name=&quot;BC_PATH&quot; value=&quot;${top.builddir}/&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;param type=&quot;token&quot; name=&quot;BC_PATH&quot; value=&quot;${top.builddir}/testsite/user/${lang}/&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/filterreader&gt;
</pre>
	<p>
		As the pipe concept in Unix, the filter concept is quite complex but
		powerful. To get a better understanding of different filters and how
		they can be used, take a look at any of the many uses of FilterChains
		in the build files for the binarycloud <a href="Bibliography.html#bc">[bc]</a>
		project.
	</p>

	<h4>
		<a name="Mappers"></a>File Mappers
	</h4>

	<p>
		With FilterChains and filters provide a powerful tool for changing <em>contents</em>
		of files, Mappers provide a powerful tool for changing the <em>names</em>
		of files.
	</p>

	<p>
		To use a Mapper, you must specify a pattern to match on and a
		replacement pattern that describes how the matched pattern should be
		transformed. The simplest form is basically no different from the DOS
		<em>copy</em> command:
	</p>

	<pre>
copy *.bat *.txt
</pre>

	<p>
		In Phing this is the <em>glob</em> Mapper:
	</p>
	<pre title="">&lt;mapper type=&quot;glob&quot; from=&quot;*.bat&quot; to=&quot;*.txt&quot;/&gt;</pre>
	<p>Phing also provides support for more complex mapping using
		regular expressions:</p>

	<pre>
&lt;mapper type=&quot;regexp&quot; from=&quot;^(.*)\.conf\.xml$$&quot; to=&quot;\1.php&quot;/&gt;
</pre>

	<p>Consider the example below to see how Mappers can be used in a
		build file. This example includes some of the other concepts
		introduced in this chapter, such as FilterChains and FileSets. If you
		don't understand everything, don't worry. The important point is that
		Mappers are types too, which can be used in tasks that support them.</p>
	<pre>&lt;copy&gt;
  &lt;fileset dir="."&gt;
    &lt;include name="*.ent.xml" /&gt;
  &lt;/fileset&gt;

  &lt;mapper type="regexp" from="^(.*)\.ent\.xml$" to="\1.php"/&gt;

  &lt;filterchain&gt;
    &lt;filterreader classname="phing.filters.XsltFilter"&gt;
      &lt;param name="style" value="ent2php.xsl" /&gt;
    &lt;/filterreader&gt;
  &lt;/filterchain&gt;
&lt;/copy&gt;
</pre>

	<p>

			href="appendixes/AppendixD-CoreTypes.html#Mappers">Appendix D</a>.
	</p>

	<h2>
		<a name="Conditions">Conditions</a>
	</h2>

	<p>
		Conditions are nested elements of the <a
			href="appendixes/AppendixB-CoreTasks.html#ConditionTask">condition</a>
		and <a href="appendixes/AppendixB-CoreTasks.html#IfTask">if</a> tasks.
	</p>

	<h4>not</h4>
	<p>
		The
		<code>&lt;not&gt;</code>
		element expects exactly one other condition to be nested into this
		element, negating the result of the condition. It doesn't have any
		attributes and accepts all nested elements of the condition task as
		nested elements as well.
	</p>

	<h4>and</h4>
	<p>
		The
		<code>&lt;and&gt;</code>
		element doesn't have any attributes and accepts an arbitrary number of
		conditions as nested elements. This condition is true if all of its
		contained conditions are, conditions will be evaluated in the order
		they have been specified in the build file.
	</p>

	<p>
		The
		<code>&lt;and&gt;</code>
		condition has the same shortcut semantics as the &amp;&amp; operator
		in some programming languages, as soon as one of the nested conditions
		is false, no other condition will be evaluated.
	</p>

	<h4>or</h4>
	<p>
		The
		<code>&lt;or&gt;</code>
		element doesn't have any attributes and accepts an arbitrary number of
		conditions as nested elements. This condition is true if at least one
		of its contained conditions is, conditions will be evaluated in the
		order they have been specified in the build file.
	</p>

	<p>
		The
		<code>&lt;or&gt;</code>
		condition has the same shortcut semantics as the || operator in some
		programming languages, as soon as one of the nested conditions is
		true, no other condition will be evaluated.
