	<h1>
		<a name="ExtendingPhing"></a>Extending Phing
	</h1>

	<p>Phing was designed to be flexible and easily extensible. Phing's
		existing core and optional tasks do provide a great deal of
		flexibility in processing files, performing database actions, and even
		getting user feedback during a build process. In some cases, however,
		the existing tasks just won't suffice and because of Phing's open,
		modular architecture adding exactly the functionality you need is
		often quite trivial.</p>
	<p>In this chapter we'll look primarily at how to create your own
		tasks, since that is probably the most useful way to extend Phing.
		We'll also give some more information about Phing's design and inner
		workings.</p>
	<h2>
		<a name="ExtensionPossibilities"></a>Extension Possibilities
	</h2>

	<p>
		There are three main areas where Phing can be extended: <a
			href="#Tasks">tasks</a>, <a href="#Types">types</a>, <a
			href="#Mappers">mappers</a>. The following sections discuss these
		options.
	</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="Tasks"></a>Tasks
	</h3>

	<p>Tasks are pieces of codes that perform an atomic action like
		installing a file. Therefore a special worker class hast to be created
		and stored in a specific location, that actually implements the job.
		The worker is just the interface to Phing that must fulfill some
		requirements discussed later in this chapter, however it can - but not
		necessarily must - use other classes, workers and libraries that aid
		performing the operations needed.</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="Types"></a>Types
	</h3>

	<p>
		Extending types is a rare need; nevertheless, you can do it. A
		possible type you might implement is <em>urlset</em>, for example.
	</p>
	<p>
		You may end up needing a new type for a task you write; for example,
		if you were writing the XSLTTask you might discover that you needed a
		special type for XSLTParams (even though in that case you could
		probably use the generic name/value Parameter type). In cases where
		the type is really only for a single task, you may want to just define
		the type class in the same file as the Task class, rather than
		creating an official stand-alone <em>Type</em>.
	</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="Mappers"></a>Mappers
	</h3>

	<p>
		Creating new mappers is also a rare need, since most everything can be
		handled by the <a
			href="appendixes/AppendixD-CoreTypes.html#regexpmapper">RegexpMapper</a>.
		The Mapper framework does provide a simple way for defining your own
		mappers to use instead, however, and mappers implement a very simple
		interface.
	</p>

	<h2>
		<a name="SourceLayout"></a>Source Layout
	</h2>

	<h3>
		<a name="FilesandDirectories"></a>Files And Directories
	</h3>

	<p>Before you are going to start to extend Phing let's have a look
		at the source layout. You should be comfortable with the organization
		of files witchin the source tree of Phing before start coding. After
		you extracted the source distribution or checked it out from CVS you
		should see the following directory structure:</p>

	<pre title="DistributionFileLayout">$PHING_HOME
  |-- bin
  |-- classes
  |    `-- phing
  |         |-- filters
  |         |    `-- util
  |         |-- mappers
  |         |-- parser
  |         |-- tasks
  |         |    |-- ext
  |         |    |-- system
  |         |    |    `-- condition
  |         |    `-- user
  |         `-- types
  |-- docs
  |    `-- phing_guide
  `-- test
       |-- classes
	   `-- etc
</pre>
	<p>The following table briefly describes the contents of the major
		directories:</p>

	<a name="tables.PhingSourceTreeDirectories"></a>
	<table>
		<caption>Phing source tree directories</caption>
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Directory</th>
				<th>Contents</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td><p>bin</p></td>
				<td>
					<p>The basic applications (phing, configure) as well as the
						wrapper scripts for different platforms (currently Unix and
						Windows).</p>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><p>classes</p></td>
				<td><p>Repository of all the classes used by Phing. This is
						the base directory that should be on the PHP include_path. In this
						directory you will find the subdirectory phing/ with all the Phing
						relevant classes.</p></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><p>docs</p></td>
				<td>
					<p>Documentation files. Generated books, online manuals as well
						as the PHPDoc generated API documentation.</p>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><p>test</p></td>
				<td>
					<p>A set of testcases for different tasks, mappers and types.
						If you are developing in CVS you should add a testcase for each
						implementation you check in.</p>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>

	<p>
		Currently there is no distinction between the <em>source</em> layout
		and the <em>build</em> layout of Phing. The <a
			href="#figures.MainDirLayout">figure above</a> shows the CVS tree
		that carries some additional files like the Phing website. Later on
		there may be a buildfile to create a clean distribution tree of Phing
		itself.
	</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="FileNamingConventions"></a>File Naming Conventions
	</h3>

	<p>There are some filenaming conventions used by Phing. Here's a
		quick rundown on the most basic conventions. A more detailed list can
		be found in [See Naming And Coding Standards]:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Filenames consist of no more or less than two elements: <em>name</em>
			and <em>extension</em> .</li>
		<li>Choose short descriptive filenames (must be less than 31
			chars)</li>
		<li>Names must not contain dots.</li>
		<li>Files containing PHP code must end with the extension <em>.php</em>
			.</li>
		<li>There must be only one class per file (no procedural methods
			allowed, use a separate file for them), with the exception of
			&quot;inner&quot;-type / helper classes that can be declared in the
			same file as the &quot;outer&quot; / main class.</li>
		<li>The name portion of the file must be named exactly like the
			class it contains.</li>
		<li>Buildfiles and configure rulesets must end with the extension
			<em>.xml</em> .</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>
		<a name="CodingStandards"></a>Coding Standards
	</h3>

	<p>We are using PEAR coding standards. We are using a less strict
		version of these standards, but we do insist that new contributions
		have phpdoc comments and make explicitly declarations about
		public/protected/private variables and methods. If you have
		suggestions about improvements to Phing codebase, don't hesitate to
		let us know.</p>

	<h2>
		<a name="SystemInitialization"></a>System Initialization
	</h2>

	<p>
		PHP installations are typically quite customized -- e.g. different
		memory_limit, execution timeout values, etc. The first thing that
		Phing does is modify PHP INI variables to create a standard PHP
		environment. This is performed by the <em>init layer</em> of Phing
		that uses a three-level initialization procedure. It basically
		consists of three different files:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Platform specific wrapper scripts in bin/</li>
		<li>Main application in bin/</li>
		<li>Phing class in classes/phing/</li>
	</ul>

	<p>At the first look this may seem to be unnecessary overhead. Why
		three levels of initialization? The main reason why there are several
		entry points is that Phing is build so that other frontends (e.g.
		PHP-GTK) could be used in place of the command line.</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="WrapperScripts"></a>Wrapper Scripts
	</h3>

	<p>This scripts are technical not required but provided for the
		ease of use. Imagine you have to type every time you want to build
		your project:</p>

	<pre>php -qC /path/to/phing/bin/phing.php -verbose all distro snapshot</pre>

	<p>Indeed that is not very elegant. Furthermore if you are lax in
		setting your environment variables these script can guess the proper
		variables for you. However you should always set them.</p>

	<p>
		The scripts are platform dependent, so you will find shell scripts for
		<em>Unix</em> like platforms (sh) as well as the batch scripts for <em>Windows</em>
		platforms. If you set-up your path properly you can call Phing
		everywhere in your system with this command-line (referring to the
		above example):
	</p>

	<pre>phing -v2 all distro</pre>

	<h3>
		<a name="MainApplication"></a>The Main Application (phing.php)
	</h3>

	<p>This is basically a wrapper for the Phing class that actually
		does all the logic for you. If you look at the sourcecode for
		phing.php you will see that all real initialization is handled in the
		Phing class. phing.php is simply the commandline entry point for
		Phing.</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="InitClass"></a>The Phing Class
	</h3>

	<p>
		Given that all the prior initialization steps passed successfully the
		Phing is included and <em>Phing::startup()</em> is invoked by the main
		application script. It sets-up the system components, system constants
		ini-settings, PEAR and some other stuff. The detailed start-up process
		is as follows:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Start Timer</li>
		<li>Set System Constants</li>
		<li>Set Ini-Settings</li>
		<li>Set Include Paths</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		After the main application completed all operations (successfully or
		unsuccessfully) it calls <em>Phing::shutdown(EXIT_CODE)</em> that
		takes care of a proper destruction of all objects and a gracefully
		termination of the program by returning an <em>exit code</em> for
		shell usage (see [See Program Exit Codes] for a list of exit codes).
	</p>

	<h2>
		<a name="SystemServices"></a>System Services
	</h2>

	<h3>
		<a name="ExceptionSystem"></a>The Exception system
	</h3>
	<p>Phing uses the PHP5 try/catch/throw Exception system. Phing
		defines a number of Exception subclasses for more fine-grained
		handling of Exceptions. Low level Exceptions that cannot be handled
		will be wrapped in a BuildException and caught by the outer-most
		catch() {} block.</p>

	<h2>
		<a name="BuildLifecycle"></a>Build Lifecycle
	</h2>
	<p>This section exists to explain -- or try -- how Phing
		&quot;works&quot;. Particularly, how Phing procedes through a build
		file and invokes tasks and types based on the tags that it encounters.</p>
	<h3>
		<a name=""></a>How Phing Parses Buildfiles
	</h3>
	<p>Phing uses an ExpatParser class and PHP's native expat XML
		functions to handle the parsing of build files. The handler classes
		all extend the phing.parser.AbstractHandler class. These handler
		classes &quot;handle&quot; the tags that are found in the buildfile.</p>
	<p>Core tasks and datatypes are mapped to XML tag names in the
		defaults.properties files -- specifically
		phing/tasks/defaults.properties and phing/types/defaults.properties.</p>
	<p>It works roughly like this:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>phing.parser.RootHandler is registered to handle the
			buildfile XML document</li>
		<li>RootHanlder expects to find exactly one element:
			&lt;project&gt;. RootHandler invokes the ProjectHandler with the
			attributes from the &lt;project&gt; tag or throws an exception if no
			&lt;project&gt; is found, or if something else is found instead.</li>
		<li>ProjectHandler expects to find &lt;target&gt; tags; for these
			ProjectHandler invokes the TargetHandler. ProjectHandler also has
			exceptions for handling certain tasks that can be performed at the
			top-level: &lt;resolve&gt;, &lt;taskdef&gt;, &lt;typedef&gt;, and
			&lt;property&gt;; for these ProjectHandler invokes the TaskHandler
			class. If a tag is presented that doesn't match any expected tags,
			then ProjectHandler assumes it is a datatype and invokes the
			DataTypeHandler.</li>
		<li>TargetHandler expects all tags to be either tasks or
			datatypes and invokes the appropriate handler (based on the mappings
			provided in the defaults.properties files).</li>
		<li>Tasks and datatypes can have nested elements, but only if
			they correspond to a create*() method in the task or datatype class.
			E.g. a nested &lt;param&gt; tag must correspond to a createParam()
			method of the task or datatype.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		<em>... More to come ...</em>

		<a name="WritingTasks"></a>Writing Tasks
	</h2>

	<h3>
		<a name="CreatingATask"></a>Creating A Task
	</h3>

	<p>We will start creating a rather simple task which basically does
		nothing more than echo a message to the screen. See [below] for the
		source code and the following [below] for the XML definition that is
		used for this task.</p>

	<a name="codelistings.MyEchoTask"></a>
	<pre
		title="Source code of a simple task that echos a message to the screen">
&lt;?php

require_once &quot;phing/Task.php&quot;;

class MyEchoTask extends Task {

    /**
     * The message passed in the buildfile.
     */
    private $message = null;

    /**
     * The setter for the attribute &quot;message&quot;
     */
    public function setMessage($str) {
        $this->message = $str;
    }

    /**
     * The init method: Do init steps.
     */
    public function init() {
      // nothing to do here
    }

    /**
     * The main entry point method.
     */
    public function main() {
      print($this->message);
    }
}

?&gt;
</pre>

	<p>
		This code contains a rather simple, but complete Phing task. It is
		assumed that the file is named <em>MyEchoTask.php</em> and placed in <em>classes/phing/tasks/my</em>
		directory. We'll explain the source code in detail shortly. But first
		we'd like to discuss how we should register the task to Phing so that
		it can be executed during the build process.
	</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="UsingTheTask"></a>Using the Task
	</h3>

	<p>The task shown [above] must somehow get called by Phing.
		Therefore it must be made available to Phing so that the buildfile
		parser is aware a correlating XML element and it's parameters. Have a
		look at the minimalistic buildfile example given in [the buildfile
		below] that does exactly this.</p>

	<a name="codelistings.BuildFileEchoTask"></a>
	<pre title="A simple buildfile that tests the echo task">
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; ?&gt;

&lt;project name=&quot;test&quot; basedir=&quot;.&quot; default=&quot;test.myecho&quot;&gt;
    &lt;taskdef name=&quot;myecho&quot; classname=&quot;phing.tasks.my.MyEchoTask&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;target name=&quot;test.myecho&quot;&gt;
      &lt;myecho message=&quot;Hello World&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
</pre>

	<p>
		Besides the XML document prolog and the shell elements that are
		required to properly execute the task (project, target) you'll find
		the <em>&lt;taskdef&gt;</em> element (line 4) that properly registers
		your custom task to Phing. For a detailed synopsis of the taskdef
		element see the [description of this task].
	</p>

	<p>
		Now, as we have registered the task by assigning a name and the worker
		class ([see source code above]) it is ready for usage within the <em>&lt;target&gt;</em>
		context (line 8). You see that we pass the message that our task
		should echo to the screen via an XML attribute called "message".
	</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="SourceDiscussion"></a>Source Discussion
	</h3>

	<p>No that you've got the knowledge to execute the task in a
		buildfile it's time to discuss how everything works.</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="TaskStructure"></a>Task Structure
	</h3>

	<p>All files containing the definition of a task class follow a
		common well formed structure:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Include/require statements to import all required classes</li>
		<li>The class declaration and definition</li>
		<li>The class's properties</li>
		<li>The class's constructor</li>
		<li>Setter methods for each XML attribute</li>
		<li>The <em>init()</em> method</li>
		<li>The <em>main()</em> method</li>
		<li>Arbitrary <em>private</em> (or <em>protected</em>)<em> </em>class
			methods</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>
		<a name="Includes"></a>Includes
	</h3>

	<p>
		Always include/require all the classes needed for this task in full
		written notation. Furthermore you should always include <em>phing/Task.php</em>
		at the very top of your include block. Then include all other required
		system or proprietary classes.
	</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="ClassDeclaration"></a>Class Declaration
	</h3>

	<p>
		If you look at line 5 in [the source code of the task] you will find
		the <em>class declaration</em>. This will be familiar to you if you
		are experienced with OOP in PHP (we assume here that you are).
		Furthermore there are some fine-grained rules you must obey when
		creating the classes (see also,[naming and coding standards]):
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Your classname must be exactly like the taskname you are
			going to implement plus the suffix "Task". In our example case the
			classname is <em>MyEchoTask</em> (constructed by the taskname
			"myecho" plus the suffix "task"). The upper/lower case casing is
			currently only for better reading. However, it is encouraged that you
			use it this way.</li>
		<li>The task class you are creating must at least extend "Task"
			to inherit all task specific methods.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>
		<a name="ClassProperties"></a>Class Properties
	</h3>

	<p>
		The next lines you are coding are class properties. Most of them are
		inherited from the Task superclass, so there's not need to redeclare
		them. Nevertheless you should <em>declare</em> the following ones by
		your own:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<!--		<li>Taskname. Always hard code the <em>taskname</em> property
			that equals the name of the XML element that your task claims.
			Currently this information is not used - but it will be in the
			future.</li> -->
		<li>Your arbitrary properties that reflect the XML
			attributes/elements which your task accepts.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>In the MyEchoTask example the coded properties can be found in
		lines 7 to 11. Give you properties meaningful descriptive names that
		clearly state their function within the context. A couple of
		properties are inherited from the superclass that must not be declared
		in the properties part of the code.</p>

	<p>For a list of inherited properties (most of them are reserved,
		so be sure not to overwrite them with your own) can be found in the
		"Phing API Reference" in the docs/api/ directory.</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="TheConstructor"></a>The Constructor
	</h3>

	<p>
		The next block that follows is the class's constructor. It must be
		present and call at least the constructor or the parent class. Of
		course, you can add some initialization data here. It is recommended
		that you <em>define</em> your prior declared properties here.
	</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="SetterMethods"></a>Setter Methods
	</h3>

	<p>
		As you can see in the XML definition of our task ([see buildfile
		above] , line 9) there is an attribute defined with the task itself,
		namely "message" with a value of the the text string that our task
		should echo. The task must somehow become aware of the attribute name
		and the value. Therefore the <em>setter methods</em> exist.
	</p>

	<p>For each attribute you want to import to the task's namespace
		you have to define a method named exactly after the very attribute
		plus the string "set" prepended. This method accepts exactly one
		parameter that holds the value of the attribute. Now you can set the a
		class internal property to the value that is passed via the setter
		method.</p>

	<p>
		In the setter method you should also perform any casting operations
		and/or check if the attribute value is a valid value. If this is not
		the case, throw a <em>BuildException</em>. In some cases, such as when
		you have three attributes and at least one of them should be set, you
		may want to check the attribute values inside the <a
			href="#InitMethod">init()</a> or <a href="#MainMethod">main()</a>
		method.
	</p>

	<p>
		In out example the setter is named <em>setMessage</em> , because the
		XML attribute the echo task accepts is "message". setMessage now takes
		the string "Hello World" provided by the parser and sets the value of
		the internal class property <em>$strMessage</em> to "Hello World". It
		is now available to the task for further disposal.
	</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="CreatorMethods"></a>Creator Methods
	</h3>

	<p>Creator methods allow you to manage nested XML tags in your new
		Phing Task.</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="InitMethod"></a><em>init()</em> Method
	</h3>

	<p>The init method gets called when the &lt;taskname&gt; xml
		element closes. It must be implemented even if it does nothing like in
		the example above. You can do init steps here required to setup your
		task object properly. After calling the Init-Method the task object
		remains untouched by the parser. Init should not perform operations
		related somehow to the action the task performs. An example of using
		init may be cleaning up the $strMessage variable in our example (i.e.
		trim($strMessage)) or importing additional workers needed for this
		task.</p>

	<p>The init method should return true or an error object evaluated
		by the governing logic. If you don't implement init method, phing will
		shout down with a fatal error.</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="MainMethod"></a><em>main()</em> Method
	</h3>

	<p>
		There is exactly one entry entry point to execute the task. It is
		called after the complete buildfile has been parsed and all targets
		and tasks have been scheduled for execution. From this point forward
		the very implementation of the tasks action starts. In case of our
		example a message (imported by the proper setter method) is Logged to
		the screen through the system's "Logger" service (the very action this
		task is written for). The <em>Log()</em> method-call in this case
		accepts two parameters: a event constant and the message to log.
	</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="ArbitraryMethods"></a>Arbitrary Methods
	</h3>

	<p>For the more or less simple cases (as our example) all the logic
		of the task is coded in the Main() method. However for more complex
		tasks common sense dictates that particular action should be swapped
		to smaller, logically contained units of code. The most common way to
		do this is separating logic into private class methods - and in even
		more complex tasks in separate libraries.</p>

	<pre>private function myPrivateMethod() {
    // definition
}
</pre>

	<h2>
		<a name="WritingTypes"></a>Writing Types
	</h2>

	<p>
		You should only create a standalone Type if the Type needs to be
		shared by more than one Task. If the Type is only needed for a
		specific Task -- for example to handle a special parameter or other
		tag needed for that Task -- then the Type class should just be defined
		within the same file as the Task. (For example, <em>phing/filters/XSLTFilter.php</em>
		also includes an XSLTParam class that is not used anywhere else.)
	</p>
	<p>
		For cases where you do need a more generic Type defined, you can
		create your own Type class -- similar to the way a Task is created [<a
			href="#WritingTasks">Writing Tasks </a>].
	</p>
	<h3>Creating a DataType</h3>
	<p>Type classes need to extend the abstract DataType class. Besides
		providing a means of categorizing types, the DataType class provides
		the methods necessary to support the &quot;refid&quot; attribute. (All
		types can be given an id, and can be referred to later using that id.)</p>
	<p>In this example we are creating a DSN type because we have
		written a number of DB-related Tasks, each of which need to know how
		to connect to the database; instead of having database parameters for
		each task, we've created a DSN type so that we can identify the
		connection params once and then use it in all our db Tasks.</p>
	<pre title="example Type">require_once &quot;phing/types/DataType.php&quot;;

/**
 * This Type represents a DB Connection.
 */
class DSN extends DataType {

  private $url;
  private $username;

	<h3>
		<a name="TypeSourceDisc"></a>Source Discussion
	</h3>
	<h4>Getters &amp; Setters</h4>
	<p>You must provide a setter method for every attribute you want to
		set from the XML build file. It is good practice to also provide a
		getter method, but in practice you can decide how your tasks will use
		your task. In the example above, we've provided a getter method for
		each attribute and we've also provided an additional method:
		DSN::getPEARDSN() which returns the DSN hash array used by PEAR::DB,
		PEAR::MDB, and Creole. Depending on the needs of the Tasks using this
		DataType, we may only wish to provide the getPEARDSN() method rather
		than a getter for each attribute.</p>
	<p>Also important to note is that the getter method needs to check
		to see whether the current DataType is a reference to a previously
		defined DataType -- the DataType::isReference() exists for this
		purpose. For this reason, the getter methods need to be called with
		the current project, because References are stored relative to a
		project.</p>
	<h4>The getRef() Method</h4>
	<p>The getRef() task needs to be implemented in your Type. This
		method is responsible for returning a referenced object; it needs to
		check to make sure the referenced object is of the correct type (i.e.
		you can't try to refer to a RegularExpresson from a DSN DataType) and
		that the reference is not circular.</p>
	<p>You can probably just copy this method from an existing Type and
		make the few changes that customize it to your Type.</p>
	<h2>
		<a name="WritingMappers"></a>Writing Mappers
	</h2>
	<p>Writing your own filename mapper classes will allow you to
		control how names are transformed in tasks like CopyTask, MoveTask,
		XSLTTask, etc. In some cases you may want to extend existing mappers
		(e.g. creating a GlobMapper that also transforms to uppercase); in
		other cases, you may simply want to create a very specific name
		transformation that isn't easily accomplished with other mappers like
		GlobMapper or RegexpMapper.</p>
	<h3>
		<a name="CreatingMapper"></a>Creating a Mapper
	</h3>
	<p>
		Writing filename mappers is simplified by interface support in PHP5.
		Essentially, your custom filename mapper must implement <em>phing.mappers.FileNameMapper</em>.
		Here's an example of a filename mapper that creates DOS-style file
		names. For this example, the &quot;to&quot; and &quot;from&quot;
		attributes are not needed because all files will be transformed. To
		see the &quot;to&quot; and &quot;from&quot; attributes in action, look
		at <em>phing.mappers.GlobMapper</em> or <em>phing.mappers.RegexpMapper</em>.
	</p>
	<pre title="sample mapper">require_once &quot;phing/mappers/FileNameMapper.php&quot;;

/**

 */
class DOSMapper implements FileNameMapper {

  /**
   * The main() method actually performs the mapping.
   *
   * In this case we transform the $sourceFilename into
   * a DOS-compatible name.  E.g.
   * ExtendingPhing.html -> EXTENDI~.DOC
   *
   * @param string $sourceFilename The name to be coverted.
   * @return array The matched filenames.
