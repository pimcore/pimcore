	<h1>Introduction</h1>

	<h2>
		<a name="WhatPhingIs"></a>What Phing Is
	</h2>

	<p>
		Phing is a project build system based on Apache ant <a
			href="Bibliography.html#ant">[ant]</a>. You can do anything with
		Phing that you could do with a traditional build system like Gnu make
		<a href="Bibliography.html#gnumake">[gnumake]</a>, and Phing's use of
		simple XML build files and extensible PHP &quot;task&quot; classes
		make it an easy-to-use and highly flexible build framework.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because Phing is based on Ant, parts of this manual are also adapted
		from the ant manual (see <a href="Bibliography.html#ant">[ant]</a>).
		We are extremely grateful to the folks in the Ant project for creating
		(and continuing to create) such an inspiring build system model, and
		for the open-source licensing that makes it possible for us to learn
		from each other and build increasingly better tools.
	</p>
	<h2>
		<a name="PhingAndBinarycloud"></a>Phing &amp; Binarycloud: History
	</h2>

	<p>Phing was originally a subproject of Binarycloud. Binarycloud is
		a highly engineered application framework, designed for use in
		enterprise environments. Binarycloud uses XML extensively for storing
		metadata about a project (configuration, nodes, widgets, site
		structure, etc.). Because Binarycloud is built for PHP, performing
		extensive XML processing and transformations on each page request is
		an unrealistic proposition. Phing is used to &quot;compile&quot; the
		XML metadata into PHP arrays that can be processed without overhead by
		PHP scripts.</p>
	<p>Of course, XML &quot;compilation&quot; is only one of many ways
		that Binarycloud uses the Phing build system. The Phing build system
		makes it possible for you to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Build multi language pages from one source tree (see
			binarycloud documentation and [below in this document]),</li>
		<li>Centralize metadata (e.g. your data model) in one XML file
			and generate several files from that XML with different XSLT.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>It the beginning, Binarycloud used the GNU make system; however,
		this approach had some drawbacks: The
		&quot;space-before-tab&quot;-problem in makefiles, the fact that it is
		only natively available for Unix systems etc. So, the need for a
		better build system arose. Apache Ant was a logical choice -- do to
		its use of XML build files and modular design. The problem was that
		Ant is written in Java, so you need to install a JVM on your computer
		to use it. Besides the need for yet another interpreter (i.e. besides
		PHP), there was also legal/ideological conflict in requiring a
		commercial JVM (there were problems with Ant on JVMs other than Sun's)
		for an LGPL'd Binarycloud.</p>

	<p>So, the development of Phing began. Phing is a build system
		written in PHP and uses the ideas of Ant. The first release was
		designed &amp; developed simultaneously, and thus not very
		sophisticated. This original system was quickly pushed to its limits
		and the need for a better Phing became a priority. Andreas Aderhold,
		who was responsible for Phing/r1, designed and wrote much of the
		Phing/r2 that followed. Phing/r2 became the Phing-1.0 that exists
		today for PHP4.</p>

	<p>The current development of Phing is focused on Phing 2, which
		has involved a number of bugfixes, functionality enhancements, and
		most significantly a conversion of the codebase to use new PHP5
		features such as abstract classes, interfaces, and try/catch/throw
		exception handling.</p>

	<h2>
		<a name="HowPhingWorks"></a>How Phing Works
	</h2>
	<p>
		Phing uses XML <em>buildfiles</em> that contain a description of the
		things to do. The buildfile is structured into targets that contain
		the actual commands to perform (e.g. commands to copy a file, delete a
		directory, perform a DB query, etc.). So, to use Phing, you would
		first write your buildfile and then you would run phing, specifying
		the target in your buildfile that you want to execute.
	</p>
	<pre title="simple phing example">% phing -f mybuildfile.xml mytarget</pre>
	<p>
		By default Phing will look for a buildfile named <em>build.xml</em>
		(so you don't have to specify the buildfile name unless it is not <em>build.xml</em>)
		and if no target is specified Phing will try to execute the default
		target, as specified in the &lt;project&gt; tag.
	</p>

	<h2>
		<a name="HowCanIHelp"></a>Cool, so how can I help?
	</h2>

	<p>Phing is under active development and there are many things to
		be done. To get involved, you can start by doing the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Read this manual to understand Phing ;-)</li>
		<li>Go to http://phing.tigris.org and subscribe to the
			&quot;users&quot; and &quot;dev&quot; mailing lists</li>
		<li>Visit the Phing <a
			href="http://www.phing.info">website</a> and look
			for open bugs / tickets</li>
		<li>Go to Phing's <a
			href="https://github.com/phingofficial/phing">GitHub</a>
			repository and submit a pull request!</li>
	</ul>
