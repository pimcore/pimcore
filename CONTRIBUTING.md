# Contributing to Pimcore

## Bug Reports & Feature Requests
The pimcore team heavily uses (and loves!) GitHub for all of our software management. 
We use GitHub issues exclusively to track all bugs and features.

* [Open an issue](https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/issues) here on GitHub. 
If you can, **please provide a fix and create a pull request (PR) instead**; this will automatically create an issue for you.
* Report security issues only by using [this form](https://pimcorehq.wufoo.com/forms/pimcore-security-report/). 
* Please be patient as not all items will be tested immediately - remember, pimcore is open source and free of charge. 
* Occasionally we'll close issues if they appear stale or are too vague - please don't take this personally! 
Please feel free to re-open issues we've closed if there's something we've missed and they still need to be addressed.

## Contributing Pull Requests

We gladly accept community pull requests. 
There are a few necessary steps before we can accept a pull request:
